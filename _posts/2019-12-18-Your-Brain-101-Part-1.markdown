Your brain is the place where all your decisions take place. For this reason, it is important to have a good idea of how the brain works so we can take good decisions and live a good life!

A lot of what follows has been inspired by the excellent book *Behave: The biology of humans at our best and worst*, by Robert Sapolsky.

**Disclaimer:** I am aware that what follows may be a *huge* simplification of how the brain actually works. But I still think it is a very useful model...

So what is the brain made of?

## Neurons and Transmitters



### Neuron basics

The brain and the nervous system are principally made of two kind of cells: **neurons** and **glial cells**. Neurons are responsible for transmitting information. When you take a decision, neurons are at work. Glial cells supports neurons and provide them with insulation between them.

Let's focus on neurons. Your brain contains around 90 billion neurons. Here is what a neuron looks like:

At one end of the neuron we find small filaments called **dendrites**. The dendrites receive information from other neurons. At the other hand is located the **axon**, which ends in numerous terminals. These terminals will transmit the information to the next neuron, by connecting to his dendrites.

The message transmitted by a neuron is an electrical flow. The inside of the membrane of a neuron contains ions (both positive and negative), just like the environment of the neuron. The distribution of these ions will determine the state of the neuron.

In a simplified summary, a neuron has two states:

- **_The resting potential_**: this is when the neuron is not excited and has "nothing to say". Its electrical charge is then negative compared to its environment: -70mV
- When the neuron receives a signal through its dendrites, its membrane will open, the ions will change their distribution, and overall the net effect will be that the neuron is more positively charged : +30mV. It is then in a state called **_Action Potential_**

The neuron will thus continuously commute between two states:

- **Action potential: "I have something to say"...**
- **Resting potential: "I have nothing to say"...**

When the neuron switch to an action potential, this potential propagates along the axon and is transmitted  through the axon terminals to the next neurons' dendrites.

### Synapses, activation and connections

Now it gets a bit more difficult: a neuron is not that easily excited! If it receives an excitation signal from another neuron, this signal won't be enough to switch from a resting potential to an action potential. Instead, its potential will become just a little bit less negative (it will go for instance from -70mV to -60 mV).

In order to switch to an action potential, the neuron needs to receive excitation signals from many neurons at the same time! It has in effect an activation function : **there is a threshold to overcome so that it actually switches.** For a signal to be transmitted between neurons, a lot of connections have to be made. And as you can imagine, there are indeed a monstrous number of such connections in the brain: around 100 trillion!

Let's talk about these connections: between the axon terminals of an emitting neuron and the dendrites of a receiving neuron, there is a space called the **_synapse_**.

Through the synapse, the axon will send chemical compounds called **_neurotransmitters_**, which are received by the dendrites of the receiving neuron. The more neurotransmitters received, the stronger the transmitted signal.

Some of these transmitters are actually famous, we will talk about them later: dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline...

**Fun fact:** you may have heard of Indians from South American hunting with blowpipes and darts poisoned with curare. This poison acts by inhibiting the acetylcholine neurotransmitter. This transmitter is responsible (among other things) for stimulating your diaphragm to contract. Poisoned with curare, the target stop breathing and dies.

As we have many different neurotransmitters, they have different effects on neurons. In particular, there are transmitters that, instead of increasing the potential of the neuron (to get closer of the action potential) actually do the opposite. They decrease the potential of the receiving neuron, and make it harder for him to get activated.

The important consequence of this is that some neurons can inhibit other neurons and **we can generalize it to the whole brain!** Indeed, some brain parts can inhibit other parts of the brain. When a group of neurons send a signal to activate or inhibit another group of neurons, the mechanism is called a **_neuronal projection_**. We will see next that neuronal projections are the meat and potatoes of how the brain works.

Alright, now that we have a basic understanding of how neurons work, let's have a look at the bigger picture: the brain and its different parts, and how they interact.

## The three-layered brain

Having a fully accurate model of the brain would prove absolutely impossible. Nevertheless, Paul McLean proposed a fascinating model describing the brain in three layers:

- The first and deeper layer, called the **reptilian brain** (or the brain stem). It is in charge of the heart's regulation, breathing, perspiration and temperature, as well as various primary needs.
- The second layer is called the **limbic system**, and communicates directly with the first layer. The limbic brain is responsible for emotions.
- The outer and third layer, called the **neocortex**. It is responsible for cognition, memory, abstraction, language. To get any action done, it needs to communicate with the limbic system, who will in turn communicate with the reptilian brain.

### The Reptilian Brain

The reptilian brain is in charge of autonomic functions of the body, which are divided in two parts:

- The sympathetic nervous system (SNS), who manages the response of the human body to stressing stimuli (increase of the heart rate, pulmonary rate...) The SNS is absolutely primordial in cases of emergency (If you see a lion, your SNS takes over, increasing your heart rate and optimising many  variables in your body to perform the sprint of your life). The SNS neurotransmitters are the noradrenaline and the adrenaline.
- The parasympathetic nervous system, which on the other hand maintains the body in a state of rest and digestion. Its neurotransmitter is the acetylcholine (whom we met before in the curare example...)

To function properly, the human body needs a good balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and the reptilian brain is responsible for it.

> **What is very important to understand is that any physical action taken by your body has been triggered through your reptilian brain. Either directly, or indirectly from upper layers.**

Let's see an example:

If you have a full bladder, the circuitry of your reptilian brain will vote for urinating, which is an autonomic bodily function. Now if you experience something absolutely terrifying, your limbic system (in charge of emotions) will persuade your reptilian brain to do the same.

As a consequence, **emotions can change bodily functions through neuronal projections**, and we will see as well how cognition can impact emotions or vice versa. **The neocortex and the limbic system have something to say about how your bodily function perform!**

### The Lymbic System



As we said, the limbic system is the second layer of the brain, responsible for emotions. In particular, let's focus on an area the size of a small nut, called the **amygdala**.

The core role of the amygdala is to throw alerts when something is off.

It certainly comes from the time where our ancestors were living in the Savannah: if something moves in a bush, it is much better to throw an alert through the amygdala (this is a lion!) , run away and think later. In case it was actually a lion, the amygdala saved our life. The guy staying there thinking "Maybe it is a lion, maybe not, i am not sure, let's check it out" would not have survived and passed its genes.

But this life-saving feature comes with a lot of drawbacks...

The amygdala is preponderant in aggression : when it is stimulated, the aggressiveness of an individual increases.

The amygdala is also a central element in experiencing **fear, anxiety and incertitude**, even in a social context.  For instance, when someone is not sure about how to comply to the social norms of his surroundings, he will experience an activation of his amygdala, which then will do a neuronal projection to the reptilian brain so that the person will show physical signs of anxiety...

A troubling fact about the amygdala is how it processes sensory data (image, sounds, ...). The amygdala has access to super fast sensory neural circuitry, but which lacks accuracy. When our eyes see something, the amygdala is usually among the firsts notified (way before the rest of our cognitive circuits).  On the other hand, the amygdala is never really sure of what it saw, since its neural connections lack precision. The picture it receives is blurry and lacking contrast.

In high stress environment, this can lead to tragic situations: for instance, the amygdala could decide it is seeing a gun, whereas the cognitive zones of the brain would figure out it is actually a cellphone. Since the amygdala will be the first one to act on the reptilian brain, it is easy to imagine how dire the consequences could be.

But the amygdala has also an impact on the outer layer of the brain (the neocortex, see below). For instance, by influencing the part responsible for factual memory (the hippocampus) the brain can learn a fear!

But enough about the amygdala, let's talk now about the last layer of the brain, in charge of cognitive activities... the neocortex!

### The Neocortex

The outer layer of the brain is called the neocortex. It is the part of the brain we often link to **_"Rationality"_**. In a nutshell, **its role is to choose the harder choice when it is the right thing to do.** It regulates emotions, masters the impulsivity, organizes the knowledge strategically and then initiates an action based on a decision...

The neocortex is the most recently evolve part of the brain. When we compare a human brain with a primate's one, the most striking difference will be in the size of the neocortex, and most notably in the pre-frontal cortex (the part located in the front of the brain). The pre-frontal cortex has a role of decider and often chooses between several conflicting choices (for instance, an cognitive decision versus an emotive one). It also has a dominating role in sorting things by categories and creating abstractions!

It is most active when we focus on a task, or we pay attention to a detail. It will be intensively stimulated as well when we delay gratification.

Unfortunately, **the frontal cortex consumes a lot of energy**, especially when it is focusing on something. If we allocate many resources to a cognitive task, the following tasks will be negatively impacted, because the brain does not have access to infinite amounts of energy. **As a direct consequence, willpower is a finite resource!**

Another limitation: compared to the rest of the brain, the neocortex is quite slow to process information... it is the perfect antagonist of the amygdala: when the neocortex is slow but accurate, the amygdala and the limbic system are super fast, but grossly inaccurate.

Finally, the neocortex is usually able to take the "right" decision by inhibiting the limbic system (remember the neuronal projection inhibiting other neurons!). This forbids the brain to take purely emotional emotions, however we will now see that it is not always the case...

### Sequence of decision

What happens when the brain is stimulated by an external system, for instance seeing a new picture?

We know that the quickest to react will be the limbic system, thanks to its very fast circuitry. At this moment, the brain will a rough idea of what is going on and start experiencing emotions, **_but it is not yet conscious of it_**.

Then the information will arrive to the neocortex who will process it.

But then, something weird happens.

We would expect our brain to be fully rational and to handle in a correct an cognitively accurate the information provided by the signal, right?

Well, it is not that simple... **The result will unfortunately be very dependent on the focus that we allocate to the processing...**

- If we are focused and mentally rested, the neocortex will activate, organize knowledge and take a rational decision based on facts, as we would expect.
- But that's actually not often the case. What happens most of the case is that, being very demanding in energy, the cortex will become lazy, and become influenced by the limbic system. Instead of reasoning rationally, the neocortex will look for a reason to **_rationalize_** the decision that has already been taken by the limbic system... The decision of the limbic system is taken for granted, and the Neocortex is busy to make it look good!

This is huge; most of the time, the human brain is not a rational machine, but a **_rationalizing_** machine!

In the first case, it starts from the facts to arrive to a conclusion.

In the second case, the brain starts from the conclusion it wants to reach (and dictated by the limbic system), and selects the facts that support this conclusion!

As a result, the brain has a built-in confirmation bias mechanism... **If we don't pay attention, we are most likely to only filter arguments that comfort our pre-existing opinions...**

> Faced with the **choice between changing** one's mind and **proving** that there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the **proof**. *John Kenneth Galbraith*
