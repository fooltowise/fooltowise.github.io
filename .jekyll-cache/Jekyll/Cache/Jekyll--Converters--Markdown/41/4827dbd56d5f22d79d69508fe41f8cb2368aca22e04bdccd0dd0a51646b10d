I"¦<p>Hello dear reader! Welcome to <em>From Fool to Wise</em>, a blog about my quest towards acquiring wisdom, making better decisions and living a good life.
Iâ€™m Julien, a french software engineer living in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland since 2016.</p>

<p>On this blog I plan to talk about many topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rationality</li>
  <li>Avoiding Stupidity</li>
  <li>Financial Independence</li>
  <li>Making good decisions</li>
  <li>Mental Models</li>
  <li>Happiness and family</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-it-all-started">Where it all started</h2>

<p>Soon after I arrived in Switzerland, I became quickly interested in the topic of financial independence.
In short, this is about <em>having enough passive income to cover your basic needs and not needing to work for money</em>. I dug deep in the subject, but quickly I realized that the more I went through it, the more new questions were arising:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I donâ€™t work, what will I do with my life?</li>
  <li>Why do I want freedom? Am I sure that financial independence will be translated in freedom <em>to</em>, rather than freedom <em>from</em>?</li>
  <li>Financial independence is about making sound financial decisions. It is avoidance of stupidity applied to the financial world. How can I translate it to other areas of my life?</li>
  <li>Why is it that seemingly smart people are often unhappy?</li>
  <li>Why is it that those same smart people make often dumb decisions?</li>
</ul>

<p>I quickly realized that what I initially thought was only about maths and money would very quickly drift towards more philosophical questions!</p>

<p>I needed someone who could help me to think about these themes. But fortunately, I was far to be the first person asking these questions.
From ancient stoic philosopher to contemporary role models like Charlie Munger and Naval Ravikant, I discovered new frameworks to help me think in my everyday life about these difficult questions.</p>

<p>This website is a documentation of my discovery of these frameworks, and how I apply them in my life to stay away from stupid mistakes and try to lean towards a wiser life.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-you-expect-from-this-blog">What should you expect from this blog?</h2>

<p>Good question, dear reader. My  purpose in writing this blog is to expose my thought process, so I can discuss it with you afterward.</p>

<p>My blog will thus allow me to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn about many topics, mainly about how to live a good live and make better decisions</li>
  <li>Meet people with a similar mindset. Where are you guys?</li>
  <li>Discover people who are much farther down the road through their personal journey towards worldly wisdom.</li>
  <li>Highlight my stupid mistakes when they occur, so that other people can learn from them.</li>
  <li>Sharpen my mind. Explaining a topic to someone else is learning it a second time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thatâ€™s all for today! Letâ€™s hope there will be many more posts to come!</p>
