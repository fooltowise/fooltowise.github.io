I"[<p>This is second part of my series of articles on how the brain works. In the last part, <a href="/Your-Brain-101-Part-1">we saw how neurons work and how they interact</a>. We also so a model of how they are organized in three “layers” in the brain.
In this part I want to present the works of Nobel Prize laureate Daniel Kahneman and the late Amos Tversky. They have shown that our brain often behaves as if two agents with wildly differing characteristics were in control. Most of what I will talk about is sourced from the excellent book <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman.</p>
