<p>My name is Julien Husser. I do many things, including developing software, investing, writing and drinking way too much tea. 
I am 34 and currently live in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, with my wife and my son.</p>

<p>This website is a collection of my favorite topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Investing</strong> - How and where to allocate capital.</li>
  <li><strong>Psychology</strong> - Why do we do the things we do, even if they donâ€™t make sense.</li>
  <li><strong>Rationality</strong> - I try to be a little bit less stupid everyday. It works better than trying to be brilliant.</li>
</ul>

<p>I created <em>From Fool To Wise</em> as an excuse to practice my writing skills, and to clarify my mind.
I believe that writing is the ultimate tool to make sure i understand a topic. When I think about something, it is easy to get carried away and to forget a link between two arguments. This cannot happen when I write. Laying my ideas on paper allows me to see where the cracks in my reasoning are.</p>

<p>In addition to my <a href="/categories.html">essays</a>, I also maintain a list of all the interesting <a href="/links.html">links</a> and concepts that have been consequential to shape my thinking.</p>

<p>Finally, through this website I hope to reach like-minded people so we can generate even more ideas. I am looking forward to discussing with you!</p>
