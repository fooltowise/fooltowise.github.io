Hello dear reader! Welcome to _From Fool to Wise_, a blog about my quest towards acquiring wisdom, making better decisions and living a good life.
I'm Julien, a french software engineer living in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland since 2016. 

On this blog I plan to talk about many topics:
- Rationality
- Avoiding Stupidity
- Financial Independence
- Making good decisions
- Mental Models
- Happiness and family 


## Where it all started

Soon after I arrived in Switzerland, I became quickly interested in the topic of financial independence. 
In short, this is about _having enough passive income to cover your basic needs and not needing to work for money_. I dug deep in the subject, but quickly I realized that the more I went through it, the more new questions were arising:

- If I don't work, what will I do with my life?
- Why do I want freedom? Am I sure that financial independence will be translated in freedom _to_, rather than freedom _from_?
- Financial independence is about making sound financial decisions. It is avoidance of stupidity applied to the financial world. How can I translate it to other areas of my life?
- Why is it that seemingly smart people are often unhappy? 
- Why is it that those same smart people make often dumb decisions?

I quickly realized that what I initially thought was only about maths and money would very quickly drift towards more philosophical questions!

I needed someone who could help me to think about these themes. But fortunately, I was far to be the first person asking these questions.
From ancient stoic philosopher to contempory rolemodels like Charlie Munger and Naval Ravikant, I discovered new frameworks to help me think in my everyday life about these difficult questions.

This website is a documentation of my discovery of these frameworks, and how I apply them in my life to stay away from stupid mistakes and try to lean towards a wiser life.

## What should you expect from this blog?

Good question, dear reader. My  purpose in writing this blog is to expose my thought process, so I can discuss it with you afterward.

My blog will thus allow me to:

- Learn about many topics, mainly about how to live a good live and make better decisions 
- Meet people with a similar mindset. Where are you guys?
- Discover people who are much farther down the road through their personal journey towards worldly wisdom.
- Highlight my stupid mistakes when they occur, so that other people can learn from them.
- Sharpen my mind. Explaining a topic to someone else is learning it a second time.

That's all for today! Let's hope there will be many more posts to come!
