I am 35 and currently live in Zürich, Switzerland, with my wife and my son. This website is a collection of my favorite topics:  Investing - How and where to allocate capital.  Psychology - Why do we do the things we do, even if they don’t make sense.  Rationality - I try to be a little bit less stupid everyday. It works better than trying to be brilliant. I created From Fool To Wise as an excuse to practice my writing skills, and to clarify my mind. I believe that writing is the ultimate tool to make sure i understand a topic. When I think about something, it is easy to get carried away and to forget a link between two arguments. This cannot happen when I write. Laying my ideas on paper allows me to see where the cracks in my reasoning are. In addition to my essays, I also maintain a list of all the interesting links and concepts that have been consequential to shape my thinking. Finally, through this website I hope to reach like-minded people so we can generate even more ideas. I am looking forward to discussing with you! "

    "title": "A Pragmatic Approach to Market Efficiency",
    "body": "2021/09/14 - The hypothesis that did not want to die: ​	Wherever you look in modern finance, one concept permeates everything. You cannot escape the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). From Modern Portfolio Theory to derivative pricing, to everyday finance jargon terms such as alpha and beta, the inevitable assumption is that markets are efficient. Prices reflect every information available - investors cannot generate superior returns other than by luck or by taking more risks. ​	But when we look at reality, things are not so clear. How accurate is the Efficient Market Hypothesis? Can we really assume that markets are efficient - or at least, efficient enough that investors cannot generate excess returns? What are the consequences for investing strategies? The Efficient Market Hypothesis exists in various forms, each one being more or less restrictive. For instance, the Strong Form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis claims that all existing information, public and private, is reflected in all asset prices at all times. It follows that no investor can possibly gain any advantage by trading an asset based on insider information. ​	Well, at least this form is easy to refute: Insider trading is a criminal offense in most countries for good reasons.  In November 1986, Ivan Boesky - one of the most famous investors at the time - was arrested and charged for insider trading. He had entered an illegal arrangement with Martin Seigel, an investment banker from Kidder, Peabody and Co. Between 1982 and 1986, Boesky paid Seigel around USD 700’000 to have access to inside information about the bank clients’ pending corporate transactions. The stock price of the client companies moved sharply when their corporate deals became public, and Boesky netted USD 33 million thanks to Seigel’s information over this period. He did a similar arrangement with Denis Levine, an investment banker at Drexel Burnham Lambert, which made him more than USD 50 million in profits. Because Boesky seemed to hit home runs on almost every M&amp;A deals in the 1980s, the SEC realized something was fishy and started investigating. Ivan Boesky pleaded guilty, served two years in jail and was fined USD 100 million. This story illustrates how private information can give a material advantage to any investor acting on it before it gets published. The strong form of the EMH does not stand up to scrutiny. ​	That’s where the Semi-Strong Form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis comes in. This variant claims that current asset prices reflect all publicly available information. No amount of fundamental analysis based on public information can give any edge to any investor. As the saying goes, nobody can beat the market, except by sheer luck or more risk-taking. The consequences are profound. If the hypothesis is correct, then the asset prices reflect asset values and do not offer any arbitrage opportunity. This sounds reasonable, but how well does it fare against reality? There are two ways to figure out if this EMH form is valid. We can try to find investors who generated superior results for a prolonged period or time. We can also try to isolate past market behaviours were it was obvious that markets were dislocated and price diverged materially from value. Both approaches lead to interesting results. Enter the Hall of Fame: In Excess Returns: A comparative study of the methods of the world’s greatest investors (Harriman House, published in 2015), Frederik Vanhaverbeke dresses a selection of investors who outperformed materially the S&amp;P 500 Index for significant periods.

But it would be very surprising if all their track records were due to luck alone. Even more so when the track record is longer than 30 years (Buffett, Carret, Schloss, Templeton, Price, Soros, Davis, Vandenberg…) I am well aware of survivorship bias, but the luck required to generate such returns over such a long term is astronomical. Most market participants won’t beat the market (more on that later), but it looks like a few skilled ones (to only talk about those keeping a public profile) managed to take advantage of it for a very long time. Mr Market, a manic-depressive fellow: Another way to check the Efficient Market Hypothesis against reality is simply to look for market facts that don’t make any rational sense. Here as well, a close inquiry will lead us to find elements disfavoring market rationality. Let’s address the elephant in the room: of all market oddities, crashes are the most striking example of irrationality. And what better example than the October 19th, 1987 crash? On this memorable Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index dropped 22. 6% in a single day, while the S&amp;P500 dropped 20. 4%. On no particular news, the market valuation of the whole American Economy was suddenly valued one fifth to one fourth less than it was at the previous session. It is difficult to argue that both valuations on Friday, October 16th and Monday, October 19th were absolutely correct and rational. Either the former was too high or the later was too low (or, more probably, both were wrong). On a more vivid note, it would be hard not to mention the March 2020 market panic related to the Covid-19 pandemic. As an example among many, on March 18th, the Smithson Investment Trust, a fund quoted on the London Stock Exchange, published a Net Asset Value (NAV) of 1099 pence per share. At the same exact moment, those shares were trading at 910 pence per share, a 20% difference. It would maybe have made sense if Smithson’s holdings were made of companies with weak balance sheet and poor profitability, but the reality is at the exact opposite. Smithson holds only companies with high return on capital, strong reinvestment opportunities, and rock-solid balance sheets. Such a difference between price and net asset value was never justified, but the overall market panic created such opportunities. We don’t need to go to such extremes to find market inefficiencies. Take a normal year (2018), and the five biggest and most scrutinized listed companies at the time: Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corporation, Amazon. com Inc. and Facebook Inc.  Over the 52-weeks period that made 2018, retrieve the lowest price and the highest price reached by each company, and look at the difference between both:           Lowest Price (USD)   Highest Price (USD)   Difference         Apple Inc.    38. 79   58. 02   49. 57%       Alphabet Inc.    991. 25   1285   29. 63%       Microsoft Corporation   85. 95   115. 61   34. 51%       Amazon. com Inc.    1189   2039   71. 49%       Facebook Inc.    131. 09   217. 5   65. 92%   Most of them had price differences of more than 30% over the period (Alphabet, the exception, was more than 29%). For Amazon and Facebook, the difference was more than 60%. These numbers represent differences in valuation of several hundreds of billion dollars! It is hard to believe that the business value of these companies changed so much over a single year. It is more likely that for each of them, at least one or both of these prices were plainly wrong. And those are the most studied companies on the planet. I don’t want to go to the other extreme and say that markets are absolutely inefficient all the time. We have shown that ineffiencies do occur, but on the other hand, very often market prices seem to make sense. Sometimes markets are pretty efficient, and sometimes they aren’t. What would explain this behavior? The Drivers of Market Efficiency: The wrong way to go at it would be to say: “Well, the market is made of human beings, and people are irrational, so the market is irrational. ” Since the advent of behavioral finance - and especially the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky - we know that the human brain is subject to various cognitive biases. These prevent us to behave in a completely rational way. But it does not matter if people are irrational, what matters is if they are all irrational at the same time in the same way. Let’s illustrate that with the story of Galton’s Ox. In More than you know, Michael Mauboussin writes: In a 1907 Nature article, “Vox Populi”, Victorian polymath Francis Galton describes a contest to guess the weight of an ox at the West of England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition in Plymouth. He collected 787 participants who each paid a sixpenny fee to participate (a small cost to deter practical joking). According to Galton, some of the competitors were butchers and farmers, likely experts at guessing the weight. He surmised that many others, though, were guided by “such information as they might pick up” or “by their own fancies”. Galton calculated the median estimate - the vox populi - as well as the mean. He found that the median guess was within 0. 8 percent of the correct weight, and that the mean of the guesses was within 0. 01 percent. To give a sense of how the answer emerged, Galton showed the full distribution of answers. Simply stated, the errors cancel out and the result is distilled information. Mauboussin reiterated the experiment in 2007 by asking his class at the Columbia Business School to estimate the number of Jelly beans in a jar. While the actual number was 1’116, guesses ranged from 250 to 4’100, with an average error of 700 - in other words, students were awful estimators. But the average guess was 1’151 (only 3% off the correct answer), and only two of the 73 students guessed better than the class average. Even if humans are irrational, there are certain conditions where a human gathering can generate a “Wisdom of the Crowds” phenomena - the crowd solves a problem better than most individuals. On the other hand, we have shown that in other situations, the same crowd can fall victim to a “Madness of the Crowds” mechanism, in particular in times of bubbles and crashes. So what are the drivers of market efficiency? To be efficient, markets need:  Numerous participants and diverse opinions.  An aggregation mechanism for these opinions.  An incentive for each participant to get it right. The market price mechanism is how we aggregate all participants’ opinions. Participants need to be incentivized to guess the “right” price, otherwise any guess is as good as any other. Finally, having numerous and diverse opinions allows for errors to cancel out and the market price to get as close as possible to assets’ true value. When these three criteria are met, markets are as efficient as can be. The interesting question is then: to which extent can we breach these criteria? Let’s get out of the way the aggregation mechanism because it’s the hardest criterion to breach and such a breach would happen very rarely. So rarely, in fact, that I could not find any example for this. I could imagine that someone would be able to purposefully “rig” a market, but market rigging is a crime in most jurisdictions. Although a failure is theoretically not impossible, we can consider that, in general, markets do an outstanding job at aggregating participants’ opinions. When opinions become scarce: On the other hand, a lack of diverse opinions is much more common. Nowhere is it more common than during bubbles and crashes. When asset prices have been going higher for a long time in a bull market, greed tends to take over rational thinking.  Social proof is getting insidious: people watch their neighbor getting wealthy in the stock market and want to participate. Everybody thinks there is only one direction for asset prices: up and to the right. This mechanism feeds into itself in a reinforcing loop and prices go parabolic. At this point nobody is considering actually losing money in the market; prices only go up! Pessimists are loudly criticised (and often labeled as anti-patriotic) and diversity of opinion is as thin as can be. The result is clear: prices diverge materially from asset values and overshoot. Bear markets and crashes display similar characteristics: everybody has been losing money for some while, and many people want to get out of the market. Some are forced to sell their holdings because of financial leverage playing against them. The public in general don’t want to get in: everybody knows some uncle who lost so much money in the stock market. This also feeds into a self-reinforcing loop. Prices go lower and lower, and people become even more pessimistic, driving prices even lower. The few individuals going against the grain, saying that those prices are a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity, are publicly called fools. Here again, diversity of opinions becomes scarcity of opinion. Prices diverge from asset values and everything is cheap. Bubbles and crashes are the two obvious occasions where diversity of opinion is lacking. Can we find more examples? Well, consider this statistic: the average holding period for a stock on the New York Stock Exchange is 8. 5 months. According to a Reuters article, it even reached a low of 5. 5 months in 2020. If you have read one of my previous articles, you may recall that more than 75% of the value of a company resides in what happens after the next ten years. But are most investors interested in what happens to a company after the next decade? I don’t think so. With such a short holding period, they are, at best, interested in the results of the next 2 to 3 quarters, and will sell afterward. We have a hyper-discounting of distant cash flows - to the benefit of what is happening right now in the near future. If true, consider what this would mean for quality companies. They usually feature a good return on invested capital and large opportunities to reinvest profits. They are most likely to show enormous compounded profit in the distant future, provided they have a high barrier to entry. But because these profits are hyper-discounted (investors’ behavior shows that they are more interested in what happens this year than in the next ten and beyond), these companies’ stocks are likely to be systematically underpriced. True, this number is highly impacted by high-frequency trading - there are a lot of investors who keep their stocks for much longer periods. But consider a thought experiment where the investing population is made of two tribes: pure buy-and-hold investors on one hand, and high-frequency traders on the other hand. Who would generate most of the trading activity? High-frequency traders. Therefore, who would set most prices? High-frequency traders. On which basis would those prices be based? a) Long-term cash flows, or b) for what traders expect to sell their stocks in the next ten minutes? I’ll let you answer this one. Obviously, the real investing population is more diverse than in this thought experiment, and holding periods for each participant will fall on a continuum. Nevertheless, an average holding period of less than a year for the whole population is still exceedingly low. The Principal-Agent Problem: The last market efficiency criterion is that participants need to have an incentive to get it right. At first sight, this is an easy requirement. Every investor wants to make money in the stock market, so there is nothing to look at here, correct? Well, not so fast. Investors who invest their own money directly do want to get the best returns possible. But what about people taking investing decisions on behalf of investors? Here I am talking about fund managers and portfolio managers who often have a mandate by their clients to manage their money on their behalf. Most of them do manage their clients’ money with the best intentions, but can we be sure it is always the case? In a 2020 Morningstar article, Russel Kinnel studied the number of funds in which the fund managers had made a substantial investment of their own money. Because the SEC requires managers to report fund ownership of at least $1million, this was chosen as the arbitrary threshold for the study. Out of an universe of 7’424 funds, only 1’155 had at least one manager with more than USD1 million invested. That means that the managers of 6’269 funds, or 84% of the fund universe, did not invest a significant amount of money in their own fund. Why would that be the case? Is it because of the arbitrary $1 million threshold - many managers did invest a meaningful amount their saving, but being not wealthy enough, the invested amount falls below the SEC reporting requirement? If so, then why are they not already wealthy managing their own money? Why should external investors trust them with their money when those managers failed to demonstrate an ability to compound their own money to a respectable level of wealth in a first time? If on the other hand, the managers are already wealthy enough, but did not deemed it necessary to invest a substantial part of their wealth in the fund, what does it mean about their conviction in their own ability? What’s more, their subsequent behavior will likely be determined by how they are compensated: what are the incentives? The standard compensation for mutual funds and ETFs is to charge a fixed annual management fee proportional to the amount of assets under management. In the case of hedge funds, a performance fee might be added, but this is still on top of a management fees. Furthermore, hedge funds assets under management (around $4. 32 trillion in June 2021) are an order of magnitude smaller than those of mutual funds ($23. 9 trillion in the US in 2020). So the main compensation in the industry is a management fees irrespective of performance, and most fund managers don’t invest a significant amount of their wealth in their own fund. There is a conflict of interest between principal (the investors in the fund) and agent (the asset manager) - the classical Principal-Agent problem. For investors, the objective is to get adequate returns. For managers, the objective is to raise as much assets as possible (the management fees is charged on an assets-under-management basis). Put yourself in the shoes of the investment management company: how can you double the amount of management fees charged? There are three solutions:  Double the management fees rate. This is hard to do because there is a lot of competition and the current general trend is to offer investors lower fees.  Generate enough investment returns to double the assets under management. That would be obviously what investors would prefer, but from the company’s point of view, this is slow and not guaranteed.  Advertise the fund to more investors so that you can have more assets under managements. As you will quickly understand, a lot of funds choose the third option. When this happens, the new rules of the game are to get as many funds inflows as possible. The needed skills are marketing and salesmanship, not portfolio management. From the manager point of view, it is far more important to avoid catastrophic returns than to be brilliant. Even if the manager fails to beat his benchmark, fund investors are unlikely to redeem their investment as long as the returns are not horrendous. As a result, the goal for the manager is not to stray to far away from his benchmark. Career risk takes over financial risk. The resulting asset allocation does not differ meaningfully from the weights inside the benchmark, a behavior called Closet Indexing. According to a 2011 Yale Study, out of a sample of $10. 13 trillion of net assets managed by mutual funds, in an additional 28% were managed by closet-indexers (in addition to 16% that were managed explicitly by index funds). The phenomenon was more pronounced for funds domiciled outside of USA, where the proportion of assets managed by closet-indexers rose to 54%! That’s not exactly what I would call an alignment of incentives. Of course, not all funds fall victims of this principal-agent conflict. Some go even to great lengths to eliminate it. For instance, Nick Sleep and Qais Zakaria, managers of the Nomad Investment Partnership, created a fee structure that would rejoice investors’ hearts:  A management fee whose sole purpose is to reimburse the running costs of the fund. In the last years of the partnership, this fee amounted to only 0. 10% of assets under management A performance fee of 20% of annual gains in excess of a hurdle of 6% over the previous year’s high watermark - acknowledging that generating at least 6% returns per year was table stakes.  Most importantly, if the fund’s current net asset value was lower than last year’s high watermark, any performance fee received in previous year was reimbursed on a pro-rata basis of the misperformance. With this fee structure, the only way for Sleep and Zakaria to make money was if Nomad generated outstanding results for its investors. With such an alignment of incentives, is it really a surprise if the Nomad Partnership generated 18. 4% per year, net of fees, over its 13 years of existence? Yes, there are managers who really care about getting it right for their investors. But then again, statistics show that not all do, far from it. Given the proportions of closet-indexers, and knowing the weight of mutual funds’ and ETFs’ assets under management compared to those of direct investors, one can ask if the incentive criterion for market efficiency always holds. Why Indexing is still one of the best strategies for most investors: So far we have spent our time poking holes in the Efficient Market Hypothesis, but at this stage I want to get one big question out of the way: what are the implications for buy-and-hold index investing? I often discuss with investors whose discourse can be summed up as: Because markets are efficient, you cannot beat the market. Therefore, if you cannot beat the market, be the market, and pay as little fees as possible while doing so. Even if by now it is clear that the premise of this argument is not sound, I have good news for passive indexers: The Efficient Market Hypothesis does not need to hold for indexing to still be the best strategy for most investors. And the reason for this is purely arithmetic. In Value Investing, Bruce Greenwald masterfully explains:  The average return earned by all investors, weighted by assets owned, in any asset category must equal the average return on the assets that make up that category. For example, the total of the returns that investors in US stocks earn in any given period must be equal to the total return produced by US stocks in that period. All these stocks are owned by somebody, and any related derivatives net out (e. g for each short seller, who does not own the shares in question, there is a corresponding buyer of those non-existent shares). Since the total value of stocks at any moment must also equal the total value of investors’ stock holdings, the average percentage return earned by investors in US stocks must equal the average percentage returns produced by the US stock market as a whole - the market return. This means that if some investors outperform the market in question, other investors must underperform by an equal amount. Before transaction costs, security trading is a zero-sum game; with transaction costs included it becomes negative-sum. Said another way, only twenty percent of the people can be in the top fifth. Let’s get a sense of this graphically. Let’s imagine a investing population, whose returns cluster around an average market return, before fees: The distribution does not need to be Gaussian, but it won’t change much to the argument. Here we have approximately half of the population enjoying above-average returns, and half of the population getting below-average returns. Now add the effects of both passive indexing and closet-indexing: many more investors will either get market returns or close-to-market returns (we are still on a pre-fees basis). What this means is that the population will be even more clustered around the average market return (i. e, the standard deviation will be smaller): We still have around 50% of the people beating the market and 50% underperforming. Now let’s introduce fees in the picture. Transaction fees, management fees, performance fees, custody fees, you name it.  The fees will translate everybody’s returns to the left hand side (note, in the background in grey, the distribution from the first graph). The combination of fees and exaggerated clustering has decimated the population of outperformers. Intuitively, outperformers went from being 50% of the population to becoming a much tinier tribe, maybe 10%. This intuition is confirmed by statistics: according to S&amp;P SPIVA reports, between 2001 and 2020, 86% of fund managers failed to outperform their benchmark. Framed another way, only one out of seven managers provides superior returns. It’s not an impossible task, it happens quite often indeed (see the hall of fame above), but it’s clearly a minority. That’s why low-cost index funds are still the best solution for investors who don’t want to spend too much time thinking about investing. They are still pretty sure to get returns superior to those of most active investors. But they should take notice that this superiority is only on a relative basis - it does not say anything about the absolute performance they will get. The market may be rational or not, and the whole asset class may be headed upwards or downwards. With the EMH, passive investors thought they were getting the “correct” price supposed to match their opportunity cost. Now without the EMH, they only know they will get market returns, whatever these are. What is left for the active investor?: Market efficiency is a paradoxical topic. We have shown that markets can be quite inefficient, but nevertheless very few people manage to beat them - only 1 out of 7 fund managers achieve this performance. Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of an aspiring investor. What lessons can he take if he wants to be a successful one? Well, let’s start with what he should not do. As we have seen earlier, he should avoid to find himself in situations where there are numerous participants with a great variety of opinions, all participants want to get it right and the market can aggregate those opinions through its price mechanism. That’s when the market is most likely to be efficient, and our investor is better off investing in a passive low-cost index fund. This also holds if he is unable to tell if he his in such a situation or not. As goes the saying, “If you’ve been playing poker for half an hour and you still don’t know who the patsy is, you’re the patsy. ” That’s the same with investing, our investor will need an edge - by finding situations where one of the three criteria for market efficiency is broken. This edge can come in a variety of flavours.  Informational edge: you have an information that nobody else has. This is very unlikely to happen, most of it is insider trading and illegal.  Analytical edge: given public information, you have a better insight than everybody else. Very hard to do when markets are efficient, but when combined with other sources of edges it acts as an amplifier.  Structural edge: you can go where other investors won’t go, don’t want to go or aren’t allowed to go. A few examples:     Microcap investing: most institutional investors cannot invest in micro capitalisation because of liquidity and regulatory constraints. Imagine a fund managing USD 1 billion of assets and a small company whose market capitalisation is only USD 50 million. Let’s say that the fund wants to take a position in the company, and make it 2% of the fund. 2% of USD 1 billion is USD 20 million, which represents 40% of the market capitalisation of the small company! The fund won’t be able to acquire its stake without moving significantly the price of the company. Let’s say it proceeds anyway to acquire its stake. With such a material ownership in the company it will have to represent the fund at the board of directors and influence operations. Finally, it’s not even clear if regulatory authorities will approve such a material ownership. So much hassle for a 2% position is not worth it. No wonder no institution will go into this area. The lack of participants (and thus of opinion diversity) makes it a fertile ground for good investment returns.    Making sure that you have a long-term horizon when most participants have a short-term one. I have already discussed above how this creates an advantage for investors in quality companies. Another good example would be how Warren Buffett structured his investment vehicle. Instead of creating a fund or an investment partnership (as he was used to do in the 1950s), he structured Berkshire Hathaway as a holding company. In a fund, when an investor wants to redeem his investment, the fund manager has to sell some of its positions to return the capital. In Berkshire, if an investor wants to redeem, he can sell his shares on the secondary market and Buffett won’t have to sell anything. This allowed him to take very long-term positions in outstanding businesses. (There are other advantages to the structure of Berkshire Hathaway. Most notably, the conglomerate owns a lot of insurance companies, and Buffett uses the insurance float - i. e the cash received in advance of claim reimbursement, which behaves like a revolving fund - as a leverage to buy more stakes in other businesses. )   Spin-offs and special situations. When a listed spins off a subsidiary, it often happens that the spinoff is materially smaller than the mother company. So small, that in a lot of cases portfolio managers receiving the spinoff will have to sell their stake - either because they don’t want to get the hassle of analysing a micro position in their portfolio, or because their mandate prohibits such holdings. Whatever the reason, this often results in a period of forced selling from institutional participants and the stock of the spinoff is temporarily depressed. This is a situation where a) other participants don’t want to get it right, and b) have only one opinion: sell, sell, sell! Although this phenomenon is less pronounced in recent years, spinoffs have been documented to generate material excess returns in the one to three years after having been spun off.     Finally, the investor can also have a behavioral edge: he is able to overcome his human nature and the various biases other people fall victim to. For instance, he is able to buy when everybody else panics, and sell in bubble territory. It looks nice on paper, but very few people are able to override their genetic wiring. They may have a different genetic disposition, and genuinely enjoy to go against the grain. But most of us are the descendants of the guy who, 50 million years ago in the Savannah, ran the hell out of there when he saw something moving on the horizon - rather than stopping and asking if it was a lion, an antelope, a fellow human or something else. Even Daniel Kahneman, who spent his whole life studying cognitive biases, happily acknowledges that he is no better at avoiding them than anyone else. Going against your wiring is hard and emotionally taxing. Another way to go at it is to implement automated investment processes where humans don’t have to participate. This is what quantitative investment companies like O’Shaughnessy Asset Management do: humans provide value by doing market research and creating investment algorithms, not by taking daily investment decisions. Markets may be inefficient, but the laws of arithmetic are such that most investors won’t do better than average. While most people will be better off investing in low-fees index funds, investors wishing to generate above average returns will need to build a consistent and repeatable edge. "

    "title": "My Framework for Investment Returns",
    "body": "2021/09/03 - Seeking a Margin of Safety in Growing Companies: As an investment practitioner, I have always been frustrated with traditional valuation methodologies. Some are too simplistic, like the comparative of multiples. A stock may be “cheap” when we look at its earnings multiple (or book value multiple) compared to other companies in the same industry. But it does not tell us anything if the whole industry is overpriced. Comparing multiples does not give us any insight about the future profitability of a companys: its earnings multiple may be half of what other businesses trade at, but if over the next years its profitability deteriorate a low multiple will be more than justified. At the other extreme, we have the Discounted Cash Flow valuation (DCF). Cherished by academic models, it requires that we forecast a company’s future cash flows until judgment day, and discount them to arrive at a present fair value. Although one hundred percent correct in theory, the DCF suffers from many shortcomings. First, any student doing the exercise will figure out that most of the fair value lies in what happens in the far future. In many cases, more than 70% of the company’s value comes from the cash flows occurring after the next 10 years. How to accurately forecast this? That’s a recipe for generating models that are very precise but entirely inaccurate. Second, which discounting rate should we use? The DCF formula is extremely sensitive to the discounting rate - changing the rate by 1% can easily increase or decrease a present value calculation by more than 50%. Furthermore, how do we compute this rate? I have always found odd when academic texts claim that the answer lies in the company’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). Shouldn’t the discounting rate be proper to each investor - that is, his opportunity cost? Let’s face it, nobody can analyse accurately all the companies on earth, let alone other asset classes. If my investment opportunities are different from yours, why should we use the same discounting rate? It looks to me like the DCF flaws make it the perfect tool to protect analysts: tweak your inputs just enough, and you can justify any valuation for a stock price. As James Montier said,  DCFs are like the Hubble Telescope. Move your settings by an inch and you end up studying a different galaxy. Of course, several improvements have been made to the DCF approach. For instance, Michael Mauboussin recommends to use it to reverse-engineer a company’s market expectations. Given a stock’s current market price, what are the implicit market expectations about its future profits? Do these expectations make sense? Reverse-engineered DCF is a big improvement. But because most of the value lies in the long term, one can easily disagree with market estimates and yet not be sure about the investment opportunity. In a low interest rates environment, if I think that a company’s long term growth will be 5% and the market think it will be 4%. This implies vastly different fair values, but it will not give me more confidence in my assumptions… In Accounting for Value, Stephen Penman improves also on the DCF by using the Residual Earnings approach, which anchors on the balance sheet and near-term earnings. This methodology works well for companies with a lot of tangible assets (think utilities, manufacturers…) and commodity businesses. But for companies where most of the profitability comes from intangibles (software, branded products…), residual earnings suffer from the same shortcomings as the DCF: most of the value lies in the distant future. Back to square one. Other approaches focusing on balance sheet analysis suffer from the same problem. The most iconic, Benjamin Graham’s Net-Net valuation, worked extremely well in the 1930s-1960s. But in modern times, businesses don’t rely as much on tangible assets as in the last century. And even for the few companies that do, it is not clear if investors would realize the company’s net working capital in case of a liquidation - contrary to last century, a liquidation nowadays would surely trigger a lot of litigation, especially with labor. Sometimes however, say in the trough of the 2008 financial crisis, one can find again companies meeting the harsh valuation criteria of the Net-net methodology. Although Graham’s technique is not practical for our investing environment, one of its features is still relevant : that’s the Margin of Safety. Given my assessment of a company, and knowing that market fluctuations are unpredictable in the short term, how much can I afford to be wrong to still realise an adequate investment return? By how much can the market move against me without jeopardising my investment thesis? Quality compounds the problem: Looking at companies benefiting from a long-term competitive advantage, the valuation only gets more difficult. These firms are usually able to compound their earnings at an attractive rate for a long period of time. They will produce huge cash flows in the distant future, but this is exactly the time horizon where the DCF and other approaches are the weakest. That’s the cruel fault of the DCF - it is the fuzziest where you need it the most. We obviously know that great companies are worth paying more. Let’s look at the four situations below, ranked by decreasing order of attractiveness:    A) A business generating $100 of profits, and able to grow them at an attractive rate without any need for incremental capital; the company distributes most of its earnings to shareholders (either as dividend or share buybacks) and will be able to grow its earnings significantly next year without any reinvestment.     B) A business generating $100 of profits, and able to grow them an attractive rate. However, it needs incremental capital to grow profits. If most earnings are distributed to shareholders, they won’t grow materially next year. A typical “Put more to get more” situation.     C) A business generating $100 of profits, but the firm needs to reinvest a significant part of its profits into the business to stay at the same level of profitability next year. Even if its financial statements show an accounting profit, most of it cannot be distributed, otherwise the business competitive situation will decline next year. It happens often when capital expenditures are dictated by what competitors are doing. Think airlines and textile industries.     D) A business generating $100 of profits, but profitability is stuck in a declining trend and will probably lead to bankruptcy.  It does not take a genius to figure out that even if all four businesses are generating $100 of profits, business A is worth a lot more than business B, which itself is worth a lot more than business C, which itself is worth more than business D. But how much should I pay for business A? When we look at market prices, quality companies rarely look cheap. Very often, these businesses are trading at P/E ratios above 30, 40, or even higher. Granted, sometimes those multiples are warranted. But many times they are not, and this is the crux of the quality investor dilemma. How do I know when I should pay up for quality - that is, to be able to generate adequate returns? On the other hand, if I find a very fine business, how do I know that its quality is not already baked in the price - therefore likely to provide unattractive returns? How does the margin of safety mechanism translates to quality businesses? A Framework for Investment returns: There is a quote from Charlie Munger that I have often encountered in the past:  “Over the long term, it’s hard for a stock to earn a much better return that the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns six percent on capital over forty years and you hold it for that forty years, you’re not going to make much different than a six percent return - even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns eighteen percent on capital over twenty or thirty years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you’ll end up with one hell of a result. ” Munger’s approach intuitively made sense, but for a long time I could not really prove it; it just “felt” right. So I decided to dig more into it to figure out where equity investment returns come from. I’d like to thank Twitter user Return On Capital, from whom I have borrowed a big part of what follows. Sorry in advance if this essay gets quite Math-y. If you are allergetic to math formulas, feel free to jump directly to the conclusions. If I purchase a share of Company A for a price P1 at time t1 and sell it later for a price P2 at time t2, my annual returns can be computed as: \[Annual \, Returns = (\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}} -1\]For instance, if I buy Microsoft stock for USD 10 and sell it 10 years later for USD 20, my annual return is roughly 7%: \[Annual \, Returns =(\frac{20}{10})^{\frac{1}{10}} -1 \approx 7 \%\]For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that this company doesn’t pay any dividend; we can check later that the approach is similar when we consider dividend returns. Let’s also assume that there is no stock split or similar corporate action. That would only complicate the formula and the final result would not be altered whatsoever. Prices can be expressed as multiples of earnings, that is, \[P_1 = E_1 * M_1  , P_2 = E_2 * M_2\]where E is an earnings measure (I personally like to use Free Cash Flows before growth capex, but feel free to use your favorite earning measure). M is the multiple on this earnings measure, such that P = M * E.  In other words, it is how much the market currently values those earnings. If you choose GAAP Earnings for E, then M is simply the P/E ratio. Our returns equation becomes: \[Annual \, Returns = (\frac{E_2 * M_2}{E_1 * M_1})^{\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}} -1\]Let T be equal to t2 - t1 (i. e, T is our holding period). Now let’s look at E2. Over the holding period T, E2 is nothing more than E1 growing at an average annual rate g. \[E_2 = E_1* (1+g)^T\]We can thus substitute for E2: \[Annual \, Returns = (\frac{E_1 *(1 +g)^{T} * M_2} {E_1 * M_1})^{\frac{1}{T}} -1\]We can simplify by E1, which leaves us with: \[Annual \, Returns = (\frac{(1 +g)^{T} * M_2} {M_1})^{\frac{1}{T}} -1 = \frac{(1 + g)} { (\frac{M_1}{M_2})^{\frac{1}{T}} }-1\]It does not look like much, but we have already come a long way! We have just shown that our returns depend only on four parameters:  The holding period The average annual earning growth over this period (and not the current level of earnings) The entry multiple and the exit multiple, and more particularly the ratio between both. All investing strategies are a play on one or more of these variables. For example:    Deep value investors care little about the business growth. They want to buy at a very low entry multiple, betting that this multiple will return to the mean after some time.     Activists investors want to influence the management of a mediocre company with room for improvement. After implementing new measures, profitability usually follows (improved g), and an improved profitability is rewarded with a higher multiple.     Speculators in meme stocks use mimetic desire and fear-of-missing out to bet that the exit multiple will be a lot higher than the entry multiple (irrespective of how the underlying business actually performs), even if the entry multiple is already at eye-watering levels. This is a perfect example of the Greater Fool Theory.     Investors in spin-offs and other special situations often rely on the institutional forced sell-off following the spin-off, leading to an artificially low entry multiple. Over the period following the spinoff the stock multiple tends to recalibrate to more normal levels, and the investor benefits from the multiple expansion.     What happens when the holding period becomes very long? That would be the case of buy-and-hold investors, either in passive index funds or quality companies. The term (M1/M2) ^(1/T) tends towards 1, and we are left with:  \[Annual \, Returns = \frac{(1 + g)} { (\frac{M_1}{M_2})^{\frac{1}{T}} }-1 \approx (1+ g) -1 \approx g\]Over the very long-term, stock prices follow earnings growth per share. A passive index fund investor will get the average growth of the economy, while the quality investor will look for businesses whose competitive advantage allow them to reinvest profits at superior rates of returns for a very long period, which should lead to a tremendous earnings growth. Of course this model has several limitations; in particular, it does not look at how earnings growth is generated:    If growth is financed by cash flows from operations (i. e the company does not need external financing), then the growth is simply the Return on Incremental Invested Capital times the portion of reinvested profits. If all profits are reinvested in the business, then the growth is equal to the Return on Capital; we are exactly in the case Charlie Munger is talking about.     If growth if financed by external capital, it often comes from two sources. The company can raise additional equity, in which case we need to check that even after dilution, earnings per share are still growing at an adequate rate. The company can also issue debt, for which it will have to pay interest. But the true cost of debt is often not the interest to pay on the debt. The true cost occurs when creditors refuse to refinance the company, leading right into bankruptcy. The cost of debt is often small, except when one most needs it. As a result, the more leveraged a company, the lower its market multiple tends to be, which reflects an increased risk of bankruptcy.  Let’s come back to Charlie Munger, and use his two businesses: one generating 18% per year, and another growing at 6% per year. What happens to investment returns? The results are displayed in the two tables below. Annual Returns - A business generating 18% per year :          Investment Time Horizon (Years)                     (M1/M2)   3   5   10   30       0. 3   76. 27%   50. 13%   33. 10%   22. 83%       0. 5   48. 67%   35. 55%   26. 47%   20. 76%       0. 7   32. 90%   26. 73%   22. 28%   19. 41%       0. 8   27. 11%   23. 39%   20. 66%   18. 88%       1   18. 00%   18. 00%   18. 00%   18. 00%       1. 5   3. 08%   8. 81%   13. 31%   16. 42%       2   -6. 34%   2. 72%   10. 10%   15. 30%       3   -18. 18%   -5. 28%   5. 72%   13. 76%       4   -25. 66%   -10. 57%   2. 72%   12. 67%       5   -30. 99%   -14. 48%   0. 46%   11. 84%   Annual Returns - A business generating 6% per year :          Investment Time Horizon (Years)                     M1/M2   3   5   10   30       0. 3   58. 34%   34. 86%   19. 56%   10. 34%       0. 5   33. 55%   21. 76%   13. 61%   8. 48%       0. 7   19. 38%   13. 84%   9. 85%   7. 27%       0. 8   14. 19%   10. 84%   8. 39%   6. 79%       1   6. 00%   6. 00%   6. 00%   6. 00%       1. 5   -7. 40%   -2. 26%   1. 79%   4. 58%       2   -15. 87%   -7. 72%   -1. 10%   3. 58%       3   -26. 50%   -14. 91%   -5. 03%   2. 19%       4   -33. 22%   -19. 67%   -7. 72%   1. 21%       5   -38. 01%   -23. 17%   -9. 76%   0. 46%   In both tables, the first column displays various scenarios for how the earnings multiples evolve over time. When M1/M2 is greater than 1, the stock will benefit from a multiple expansion over the holding period. On the contrary, when M1/M2 is smaller than 1, the stock will suffer from an multiple contraction (for example, if a market crash occurs). The next four columns sum up the average annual investment returns that an investor in these companies would get if he would hold their stock for 3,5,10 and 30 years. For instance, in the first table, we can read that if an investor holds the stock of the 18% business for 30 years, and in the mean time the market multiple halves (M1/M2 = 2), then he will enjoy annual returns of 15. 30% per year over the next 30 years. It becomes obvious that over a short-term horizon (inferior to three years), most of the returns come from the evolution of market sentiment. For instance, in the second table with the business generating 6% per year, the business’ mediocre quality does not matter at all in the first column. If the market suddenly decides to triple the business multiple over the next three years (first line, first column), investors will enjoy incredible annual returns of 58. 34% per year over those three years. But when holding periods get longer, business quality takes over. Over thirty years, investors’ returns will track closely the underlying business profitability. Even if earnings multiples triple, an investment in the 6% business will provide only 10. 34% per year. As our time horizon increases, our returns become completely dependent on the quality of the company. Margin of Safety for Growing Companies: We can improve our model by taking into account investors’ opportunity cost, i. e the returns available in their second best investment opportunity. An investor will only back a company if estimated annual returns are above his opportunity cost. Let C be our Opportunity Cost. That means that we need to meet the following condition: \[Annual \, Returns \geq C\]That is, \[\frac{(1 + g)} { (\frac{M_1}{M_2})^{\frac{1}{T}} }-1 \geq C\]Or \[\frac{(1 + g)} { (\frac{M_1}{M_2})^{\frac{1}{T}} } \geq 1+C\]A bit of refactoring gives: \[(\frac{M_1}{M_2})^{\frac{1}{T}} \leq \frac{1 + g} { 1+C}\]Finally, \[\frac{M_1}{M_2} \leq (\frac{1 + g} { 1+C})^{T}\]Let’s pause a little bit here. At this stage, what is under our control? If we have done our homework properly, we should have a firm grasp on:  Our assessment of the future probability of the company, and thus a good idea of its future growth g. If we cannot have a view on the future business prospects for the firm, we should gladly take a pass.  We control as well the time horizon over which we made the company’s assessment, T We obviously know our opportunity cost, C We can choose to invest or not at the current multiple M1The only thing we do not control is M2, that is, how the market will value future earnings when we will want to sell. Saying that we will only invest in the company at a multiple M1 if the investment annual returns are above our opportunity cost C is the same as saying that the below inequality needs to hold: \[\frac{M_1}{M_2} \leq (\frac{1 + g} { 1+C})^{T}\]That is, the multiple contraction M1/M2 needs to be kept under a certain threshold, and this threshold only depends on g (the future growth), C (the opportunity cost) and T (the holding period). Let’s see how this translates in practice. Let’s say that our opportunity cost is 10%. In the below table, the first columns gives various values for g (the earnings CAGR). The four other columns show how much multiple contraction/expansion one can endure for four different holding periods (5, 10, 15, and 20 years) while still meeting our target of a 10% opportunity cost. Margin of Safety in Multiple Contractions:          Time Horizon (Years)                     Company Earnings CAGR   5   10   15   20       0   61. 05%   159. 37%   317. 72%   572. 75%       2%   45. 87%   112. 78%   210. 38%   352. 74%       4%   32. 37%   75. 22%   131. 95%   207. 03%       6%   20. 35%   44. 83%   74. 30%   109. 77%       8%   9. 61%   20. 14%   31. 68%   44. 34%       10%   0. 00%   0. 00%   0. 00%   0. 00%       12%   -8. 62%   -16. 49%   -23. 68%   -30. 26%       15%   -19. 93%   -35. 89%   -48. 66%   -58. 89%       20%   -35. 28%   -58. 11%   -72. 89%   -82. 45%       25%   -47. 23%   -72. 15%   -85. 30%   -92. 24%       30%   -56. 62%   -81. 19%   -91. 84%   -96. 46%   This should read as: “If the company grows its profits by 15% (line 8) each year over the next 15 years (column 4), one can buy at current multiples and still enjoy investment returns north of 10% per year over the next 15 years as long as the multiple does not contract by more than 48. 66%. ” And here lies our margin of safety. Let’s say I see a company trading at 30 times earnings, and I think that it will grow its earnings by at least 20% per year for the next 10 years. Then, if I buy today, I will still enjoy returns of at least 10% per year, as long as the earnings multiple in ten years will not have contracted by more than 58. 11% (that is, if the earnings multiple in ten years is still above 12. 56). I may not know what the market will look like in ten years, nor how the market sentiment about the company will evolve, but at least I know by how much the market can contract before I stop meeting my investment goals. And this itself is powerful. Now let’s play a thought experiment and say that in ten years, the earnings multiple of our company is indeed below 12. 56. This can be due to two different reasons:  Either my assessment of the company was right (it compounded its earnings at 20% per year over the last 10 years), and the market is in the middle of a crisis, in which case the company is offered on sale, which is likely to be temporary.  Or my assessment of the company was wrong, which will get me in trouble. Not only will the final earnings lower than expected, but the market is likely to reflect a lower profitability in the exit multiple. This is why it is fundamental to have a deep understanding of the business we are investing into. We only need to have a correct insight into a few select businesses, there is no need to know everything about all businesses on earth. Now let’s go back to our margin of safety:  The more the company is able to grow, the bigger the margin of safety in multiple contraction gets. For a fixed horizon of ten years, an annual growth of 12% provide a 16. 49% margin of safety in the multiple contraction. With 20%, the margin of safety jumps to 58. 11%.  If the company’s underlying profit growth is less than our opportunity cost (in the above table, that is 10%), there is no margin of safety whatsoever related to the company’s quality. To get the desired investment returns, the investor will need a positive market re-rating (that is, an earnings multiple expansion). This can happen if the entry price is low enough (that would be the approach used by deep value investors), but this won’t happen with business development alone: the market will need a catalyst event to re-rate the company. Also, the longer the time horizon, the bigger the multiple expansion needs to be to meet our opportunity cost.  With quality companies able to grow their earnings above our opportunity cost, time is our ally. In the above table, with a company growing at 20% per year, the margin of safety on a 5-years horizon is 35. 28%. It jumps to 72. 89% over 15 years. Now let’s not fool ourselves. So far we have been acting as if we could assess accurately a business profitability over the next 5, 10, or even 15 years. First, I don’t believe that is possible for many companies: cyclical industries, commodity businesses, companies with a lot of technological disruption, etc. However, every now and then we stumble upon a business with an entrenched competitive advantage, superior return on capital and growing earnings. Paradoxically, the better the competitive advantage, the easier it is to get a qualitative idea of how long it is going to last, and how much room there is for reinvestment. The task of the investor is to find those rare businesses, and to be able to assess qualitatively to which extent their competitive position will evolve: is management busy on growing the competitive advantage? How hard would it be for a well-funded competitor to eat our lunch? How long can this last? Once the competitive moat is assessed, we need to look at how big the opportunities for investment are: is the addressable market big, or getting bigger? How fragmented is the industry? Those questions are never a one hundred percent yes and no, but answering them will give an idea about to which extent past profitability will go on, improve or worsen, and over which time horizon we are confident about our estimation. This is only after all this qualitative work, that we can look at the tables we have been devising above to consider our margin of safety. This post has been very quantitative - What are the drivers of investment returns for growing companies? But the conclusion is very qualitative. Find companies that will still be there after a multi-decade period. Ensure that they can keep competition at bay and grow their profits at attractive rates for a very long time. The higher a company scores on these criteria, the higher your margin of safety. The higher the margin of safety, the more you will be able to endure market contractions and still meet your investment goals. "

    "body": "2020/06/10 - How beliefs are created, and their consequences: Our beliefs are the core of our identity. They shape how we see the world and how we act. They help us make decisions. Our beliefs have consequences on what kind of people we frequent, how we spend our time, and why we do what we do. But how do we form them? What’s the process? Does it affect other parts in our lives? It turns out that’s the case, and what started 400 years ago as a philosophical battle has many implications in our daily lives. If you live in the western world, what follows might be an accurate description of how you think beliefs are created. First, we are presented with an idea and we comprehend it (“Rhinoceroses have six legs”). Then we assess it against what we know (“Could it be that rhinoceroses have six legs?”). Then we decide to believe it or not (“No, I don’t believe that rhinoceroses have six legs”). If this process seems obvious, it is due to one man who influenced a huge part of western philosophy : René Descartes. Descartes was the first to initiate the separation between comprehension and assessment of ideas when he partitioned the mind into two distinct domains. The first domain is the intellect, in charge of the comprehension. The intellect is passive and its job is to receive ideas, in an effortless and automatic way. The second domain is the will, which is the active part of the mind. The will is the sole decision-maker about the veracity of a statement. The intellect present ideas, and the will decide of their truthfulness. This whole concept was one of the axioms upon which Descartes built his thesis. In Principles of philosophy he wrote:  That we have power to give or withhold our assent at will, is so evident that it must be counted among the first and most common notions that are innate in us. Descartes’ description of beliefs formation became the gold standard of rationality in occident. In the french language, rational people are even said to have an esprit cartésien. Back to belief formation.  If we had to draw a workflow for Descartes’ framework, it would look like this: Comprehension =&gt; Assessment =&gt; Acceptance OR Rejection That is all well and good. Except that around the same time, another great philosopher, Baruch Spinoza, was suggesting a different process of belief formation. For Spinoza, in order to comprehend an idea, we need to implicitely accept it first . Therefore comprehending and accepting an assertion are the same operation. When meeting the idea “this elephant is pink”, the act of creating in our head the image of a pink elephant is the same as believing it. It is only after we have understood (and by the same token, accepted) the idea, that we may assess its veracity, and unaccept it if needed. No, after further assessment, this elephant is desparately gray, like any other elephant. A schema of Spinoza’s thesis would look like this: Comprehension AND Acceptance =&gt; Certification OR Unacceptance While reserving judgement about an idea is perfectly possible in Descartes’ theory, Spinoza argued that it cannot be: the idea has to be believed first, and then judged. For the following centuries, most people went along Descartes, as his theory seemed more intuitive and elegant. Scarcity of resources: But why does it matter? At the end of the day, the most important thing is that we are able to judge and assess correctly ideas and beliefs. One might argue that the intermediate steps leading to the result should not make any difference… That would be the case if our brain had infinite resources. However, by now research has shown that it is far from being the case. Countless examples demonstrate how a cognitive load on one task can prevent the brain to perform other tasks. As a result, it is perfectly possible that the process of belief formation can be interrupted if our brain is busy doing something else. Following two conversations at the same time for instance, or being distracted by an attractive member of the opposite sex. When the belief formation process is unterrupted, the belief stays “as-is” in our psyche. It will likely not be examined again: we believe we already did the work of assessing this belief. Scarcity of mental resources has different consequences depending on whether Descartes or Spinoza is right. If Descartes’ thesis is correct, then cognitive load would probably interrupt a belief during the assessment phase. As a result, a wrong assessment could lead to any outcome:  believing a false statement rejecting a true statementOn the other hand, if Spinoza is right, then the interruption of the process is done while performing the second phase : updating our belief. We are already at a step where the idea is accepted. Therefore a faulty process would keep true statements accepted, and keep false statements accepted as well. In other words, according to Spinoza, being cognitively busy increases the chances of believing everything you’re told. The experiment: Enter the psychologist Daniel Gilbert. After analyzing previous unrelated experiments, Gilbert noticed that his subjects tended to display excessive credulity while being distracted. Being aware of the dichotomy between Descartes and Spinoza, he set out to figure out how beliefs are created in our psyche. In the white paper You can’t not believe everything you read, Gilbert, Tafarodi and Malone reveal the clever psychological experiment they designed.  In the experiment, subjects had to read a pair of crime reports on a screen.  The color of the text on the screen indicated if a particular statement in the reports is true or false.  The first report contained false statements exacerbating the gravity of the crime.  The second report contained false statements decreasing the severity of the crime.  Subjects were divided in two groups: the control group and the experimental group.  Members of the control group had only to read the statements of the two crime reports.  Members of the experimental group had to read all statements of the reports, but also had to perform a digit-search task while reading the report. At the end of the experiment, every subject had to perform the following tasks:  recommend the length of prison term for each criminal.  rate criminals, from 1 to 10, on their dangerousness and dislikeableness.  perform a memory test to attest if some statements contained in the report were true or false. The digit-search task sole purpose was to stress the experimental group under cognitive load. The experiment would test not only if people were more likely to misjudge false statements than true ones (assessed by final the memory test), but also if they would act on these beliefs. The results are remarkable. Control Group:           Extenuating false statements   Exacerbating false statements   Difference             Recommended years in prison   6. 03   7. 03   -1. 00           Dislikeableness   5. 83   6. 62   -0. 79           Dangerousness   5. 63   6. 41   -1. 05       Experimental Group:           Extenuating false statements   Exacerbating false statements   Difference             Recommended years in prison   5. 83   11. 15   -5. 32           Dislikeableness   5. 18   7   -1. 82           Dangerousness   4. 82   7. 06   -2. 24                               Memory Test - Proportion of statements recognized:           Control Group   Experimental Group   Difference         True Statements:                   Recalled as true   0. 93   0. 89   0. 04       Recalled as false   0. 03   0. 06   -0. 03       Recalled as foils (*)   0. 03   0. 04   -0. 01       False Statements:                   Recalled as true   0. 23   0. 44   -0. 21       Recalled as false   0. 69   0. 34   0. 35       Recalled as foils   0. 09   0. 23   -0. 14       Foils Statements:                   Recalled as true   0. 05   0. 09   -0. 04       Recalled as false   0. 01   0. 05   -0. 04       Recalled as foils   0. 94   0. 86   0. 08   (*) foils statements are statements that never appeared in the crime reports Source While it looks like true statements were in general not impacted, the experimental group made many mistakes by considering false statements as true. Not only this, but it influenced their behavior as well.  At the extreme, subjects in the experimental group were willing to recommend a prison term almost twice longer than the control group (11 years vs 7 years) when the false statements were exacerbating the crime’s gravity. The work of Gilbert, Tafarodi and Malone vindicated Spinoza’s theory 400 years after it was enounced. First we believe in an idea, and then, maybe, we reconsider, confirm, or un-accept it. Evolution of belief formation: But why is it so? Why would a belief-forming mechanism be built this way? The software developer in me would prefer a system obeying Descartes’ description. At least, with Descartes, every single part of the system has a single responsibility. Descartes’ vision would make sense if we had to build such a system from scratch. However, from an biological point of view this system has surely evolved over time. At the beginnings of our species, our ancestors did not need a belief mechanism as complex as what we currently have. For most of our history, the signals our brain received did not need to be checked. We are mainly visual creatures, and the images coming through our eyes are very difficult to fake. Having a doubting mechanism at these times was even a competitive disadvantage. Imagine two persons, Bill and Bob, in the african savannah 100’000 years ago. Bill trusts everything coming to his brain, while Bob checks his beliefs. Now imagine that both see a lion coming towards them. Bill will immediately run away. On the other hand Bob will take some time to confirm that the lion is coming. From this point of view, it is not hard to see that given enough generations, Bill’s offsprings will outnumber Bob’s ones. Bob’s lineage will quickly exit the gene pool. However, around 70’000 years ago, Homo Sapiens underwent what Yuval Harari calls the cognitive revolution. Humans started to use more elaborated languages, and their brains were suddenly able to understand abstract concepts and discuss them. While the day-to-day physical world is hard to fake, the world of ideas is a completely different animal.  In this new environment, we can see how someone who trusts everything he’s told would run into many dangers. In order to survive, Homo Sapiens had to evolve a doubting mechanism over its existing trusting one. The resulting belief-formation system would resemble closely what Spinoza described in his Ethics. Consequences: The practical lessons we can draw from there are numerous. Independently of how our brain is wired, it should first strike you that doing any kind of knowledge task while already being under cognitive load is an appalling idea. Avoid being in these situations and you will make yourself a great service.  Avoid multi-tasking. This is the plague of knowledge workers.  Avoid states of physical or emotional stress, and chronic fatigue.  Whenever you take a decision, avoid rushing or being in a sense of urgency.  Be wary of information overload: being unable to discern what is relevant from what is not is a guarantee to make you take poor decisions. Following the guidelines above will limit the frequency when your mind will trick you, but it will not eliminate it. Knowing that in such a case you are bound to believe everything you’re told, be very wary of the following situations:  Fact-check news. In fact, avoid news totally if you can. News’ business model is to substitute sensational and drama for relevance. But don’t take my word for it. Rolf Dobelli wrote a wonderful essay on the topic.  If you still want to follow news, don’t do it while driving and listening to the radio, or reading the headlines of the newspaper while doing groceries or taking the train.  The success of tabloids and scandal magazines now makes a lot of sense: we rarely read them while being focused, and we are bound to believe all the emotional rollercoaster contained there. In a few weeks the tabloid will publish a public retractation, but the evil is already done. People already believe the emotion-laden stories and will not reassess them.  In the same vein, we can now understand why smear campaigns and defamation are so effective: by the time the court has condemn the defamatory side, public opinion is still influenced by the false statements it received. People will still believe the lies long after the truth is revealed. Our brain has a limited horsepower. Knowing about its limitations is a needed first step. But knowing when we are likely to be deceived and not going there is the beginning of avoiding stupidity. "

    "body": "2020/05/31 - Good things happen when you buy quality: Why do investors focusing on superior businesses often get attractive results? Why should quality not be offset by an expensive price? Over the last two decades, the returns achieved by private investors and fund managers buying only good businesses have been impressive enough not to be due to mere luck. Take Fundsmith for instance. Beating the global market by a wide margin is one thing. Doing it while being long-only, using no leverage nor any derivatives, and buying companies whose average market capitalization is bigger than $70 billion is yet another dimension of outperformance. If you are not familiar with the Fundsmith Equity Fund, this UK-based mutual fund is managed by Terry Smith. Created in 2010, the fund is known to only invest in outstanding businesses. It has since been returning an average compounded return of 17. 6% per year. Taking into account the weakening of the pound sterling, an US investor would still have enjoyed close to 15% per year over the last decade had he invested in the fund. Some may say that Smith got lucky by creating his fund at the beginning of the longest bull market in history. Making money in a post-2010 world would then be the mere luck of finding oneself at the right place at the right moment. But due diligence reveals that before Fundsmith, Terry Smith was already an outstanding investor. From 2003 to 2010 when he was at the head of the Tullett Liberty Pension Fund, he averaged 14% per year in spite of the great financial crisis. Now being that lucky would be remarkable. I don’t want this post to be an advertizement for Fundsmith: there are other funds and holding companies using similar principles; they all returned impressive results as well. Lindsell Train. Baillie Gifford. And if we dare going outside of the asset management industry, we’ll find of course Berkshire Hathaway, the poster-child of quality business conglomerate. No, what i want to know is what could explain such a level of outperformance. Looking at the fund’s marketing, management explains that they Buy good businesses, don’t overpay, and do nothing. It sure makes a catchy slogan. Thirty years ago, Buffett himself was writing about the same concept in his 1989 letter to shareholders:  It is far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. But why should it be a winning formula? What is the secret sauce? After some time pondering the problem, I may have found the lynchpin. It resides in one single phenomena: long-term compound interest and the human absolute inability to have a grasp at what it means. Look for compounding machines: So there it is. Compound interest. We want to own businesses that will behave like compounding machines. How do you do that? You buy extremely good quality. What kind of business is extremely good? Let’s have a look at the common characteristics in Fundsmith’s holdings. The aboslute most important feature is that all these businesses are as profitable as can be. They all benefit from a generous return on invested capital which is often greater than 25%. Every dollar invested in such a business will generate at least 25 cent year after year after year. And those are not virtual accounting earnings: the cash conversion is very close to 100%, sometimes greater due to a good working capital management. But having a good profitability means nothing if you are not able to defend it. These businesses need to be able to stay profitable over a long time. How do they fare on that scale? Once again very well. One striking feature is that these companies have considerable gross margins, often around 65-70%. It denotes a good pricing power. First, their customers are willing to buy from them at a premium price. If a company wants to raise its prices bit by bit, year after year, its clients are not going to go away. Second, such a high gross margin demonstrates a weak competition that is unable to erode their competitive advantage. This is also illustrated by the average longevity of Fundsmith’s holdings. Although there are some new players, most of these businesses have been existing for more than fifty years. Surviving for such a long time while being able to maintain good margins is a clear sign that they are perfectly able to defend their profitability. To have a compounding machine, it is not enough to be profitable, you also need to be able to reinvest the returns in the business. Not only that, but the reinvested cash needs to compound at the same high rate of returns as when it was first generated. Checking these companies, we find out that their earnings grow on average every year by 15%, without degrading the profitability. There is still a runway to reinvest half of the returns, and distribute the remaining to shareholders. A final note on business quality. Although such companies are not afraid from competition, how do they fare in period of crisis? Their revenue are often made of recurring, everyday-life small tickets such as fast moving consumer goods. Customers tend to buy those tickets even when times are difficult. For instance, during the lockdown resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, Fundsmith’s positions proved to be quite resilient: consumers still brush their teeth and feed their dogs, COVID-19 or not. There we have it: a handful of profitable, resilient, competitive businesses that will reinvest their earnings at a high rate for a long time. The textbook definition of compounding machines. Quality is underrated: Now comes a critical question: what price should we pay for such companies?Having found good compounders is one thing. But it we pay too much for them, shouldn’t we be worried that such an investment will return subpar returns? What is a correct price for these assets? Looking at Fundsmith’s holdings, they usually initiate a position when the target quality company provides a Free Cash Flow yield of 4% or more. That’s it. Hold on, what do you mean by that’s it? Why would such a rule provide superior returns? At first sight this does not make any sense. Using second-order thinking and a bit of game theory, a seasoned investor would think:  Everybody knows that this company is a first class business. As a result, investors must have bid up the share price so much that it should not offer excess returns compared to any other investment opportunity. This is at least what finance theory would state. A fair price for these businesses would be the current value of the future cash flows discounted by our opportunity cost. It should not matter if these cash flows are solid compounders, the price should converge to a value that does not provide excess returns above the opportunity cost. However, a look at the past history suggest that it is not the case. There are many examples of good and famous businesses, having a considerable market capitalization, that continued to outperform for a long time. Take L’Oréal for instance. The stock was quoting at 7. 60 EUR in 1991. At the time nobody could say this was an obscure company, and its business model was already very attractive. 29 years later, it is now quoting at 260 EUR. The stock price provided a compounded annual return of 13% per year. Taking into accounts all the dividends received over the period, a shareholder would have enjoyed total returns of 15-16% per year. And this is not an isolated example. Nike, Visa, Mastercard are all famous businesses with strong fundamentals. As far as can be from the unknown run-of-the-mill company. And yet their stock vastly outperformed the market. A last example is Moody’s. The fundamental economics of credit rating agencies are fantastic. A debt issuer wanting to attract investors has almost no other choice than going to one of the big three to rate its credit: Moody’s, Standard &amp; Poor’s, or Fitch. The industry is a prestige-based oligopoly. Let’s have a look at the business model. On the cost side, the rating agency will have to pay an analyst comfortably. Say $200’000 per year. The analyst can then appraise the creditworthiness of the client. On the revenue side, the agency will get 5 basis points of the total debt offered. With a US bond market worth 40 trillion USD and growing year after year, you can imagine how these three agencies can share with ease 200 billion USD revenues. And not only do clients have to pay for the debt issuance, but they will have to pay again every year for a re-appraisal of their credit rating. A business dream. The best part? This business is undestructible. Before the subprime crisis, credit rating agencies published poisoned ratings (remember AAA-rated CDOs?), with the result we all know. This gross misconduct did not manage to damage the industry. If this does not kill Moody’s, I don’t know what will. So we have an impressive business, known by everybody in the financial world. Surely people would have been able to price it correctly? Not at all. Moody’s stock price grew 22-fold since 2001, returning 17. 6% per year to its investors. And I am not even counting the dividends. The unbearable lightness of the brain: How come that high quality seems to be systematically underpriced then? I am not the only one person puzzled by this fact. In Quality Investing, Lawrence Cunningham already observed this phenomenon.  Equity Investors must find companies in the stock market, where theory suggests that the superior attributes of quality companies would be fairly reflected in price, offering no investing advantage. But while premiums are paid for shares of such businesses, they are frequently insufficient. Valuation premiums of quality companies reflect some degree of expected outperformance, but actual performance tend to exceed expectations over time. Stock prices thus tend to undervalue quality companies. In the same spirit, a white paper written by Cliff Asness, Andrea Frazzini and Lasse Pedersen, Quality Minus Junk, recognised that when businesses are rated by quality, high quality companies stocks tend to outperform lower quality stocks. However the theory suggests that this should not be the case. Recall that the fair value of any asset is the present value of its future cash flows, discounted at your opportunity cost. If the price is constantly too low compared to the fair value, it is either because the market uses a discount rate that is too high, or because the cash flows are under-estimated.  A high discounting rate does not make sense here: that would be equivalent to saying “the better the business, the higher the margin of safety i am asking, and the less i can trust the value of future cash flows”. Hardly believable.  Thus a more probable hypothesis would be that we constantly underestimate the future cash flows of good businesses. Could it be the case?Looking into psychology, we can see how such an outcome could occur. The human brain is not wired to understand long term compounding. Consider the following game. Would you rather receive:  a) $700’000 now b) or 1 cent doubled every day for 30 days?If you are like most people, I guess you chose $700’000. However, proposition b) is vastly more valuable. 1 cent multiplied by 2^30 is roughly equals to 10 million USD. But the way the game is presented, our brain is absolutely unable to figure out that proposition b) is worth more than ten times proposition a). If the brain has difficulties with exponential growth, but can it work in a linear fashion? It turns out that reality is even worse: Our brain can only understand logarithmic growth. Anything else must be inculcated the hard way at school. A brain built to think in a logarithmic fashion will never be able to compute an exponential growth. At best it might figure out that the result is big. But it will systematically underestimate compound interest. And this is the very reason why good businesses tend to command lower prices than expected. When tools cannot take decisions: “Wait a minute,” would you say. Our brains may be hopeless at understanding compounding, but an analyst’s spreadsheet is not. This is true, but only to the extent that the model in the spreadsheet reflects the reality. Consider the bread and butter of business valuation, the discounted cash flow analysis. When elaborating a valuation, the analyst will try to evaluate the future free cash flows of the company, discount them at their present value and sum the total to arrive to a target price. One of the biggest issues in doing so is to forecast the free cash flow growth in the future. Sure, a business might currently enjoy an attractive growth, but this can mathematically not last forever. Based on many qualitative criteria like the competitive advantage of the company, its position in the industry and its previsibility, the analyst will have to choose how long he expects the company to grow its free cash flows at a high rate. This period is often called the competitive advantage period. What this means is that afterward, the company is expected to grow very little (roughly in line with the GDP growth, or even less). Based on the quality and visibility of the business, the competitve advantage period is usually set between 3 to 10 years in the valuation model. What is crucial to notice is that the value used for the competitive advantage period has a tremendous impact on the final value of the analysis. Consider a fictitious business currently generating $1’000 of free cash flows and expecting to grow them by 15% annually thanks to some competitive advantage. There will be a time when competition will erode this advantage. Let’s say that this business will only grow 2% per year afterward. For simplicity sake we will use a 10% discounting rate. For simplicity sake as well, the business does not need external capital. All the growth comes from reinvested earnings. How does the competitive advantage period impacts the value of this business? It turns out that it matters a lot. If the analyst chooses a period of 5 years, the business is worth around $20’000. Had he chosen 10 years, the business value is now ​USD 31’000. What happens if instead the business happens to be a wonderful one, growing 15% year after year for 20 years? Its value jumps to $61’000. The valuation tripled due to the variation of a single parameter left to the appreciation of the analyst. I contend that if the company is indeed a fabulous one, very few analysts will be able to make the call and choose a competitive advantage period that is big enough. The spreadsheet knows how to do the maths, but here the issue is mainly a qualitative one. In an industry where career risk is real, i doubt a lot of analysts would dare to stick their neck out and affirm that a business will enjoy outsized returns for 12, 15, 20 years. This leads systematically to undervaluations. And undervaluation means attractive investment opportunity. On the one hand, our brains are bad with numbers, but quite good at qualitative analysis. On the other hand, spreadsheets handle natively any calculation, but are terrible at more qualitative matters. Deciding how long a business will enjoy a competitive advantage is one of those. As a result, there is a substantial probability that investors will appraise superior businesses way below their fair value. I am not saying that these businesses look cheap in any way. For instance, many of Fundsmith’s positions are trading at multiples north of 30 times earnings. But even if the price looks expensive, in many cases it is still a bargain compared to what the underlying business will deliver.  And Buffett has been saying the same for more than thirty years. "

<p>Looking into psychology, we can see how such an outcome could occur. The human brain is not wired to understand long term compounding.</p>

<p>Consider the following game. Would you rather receive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a) $700’000 now</li>
  <li>b) or 1 cent doubled every day for 30 days?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are like most people, I guess you chose $700’000. However, proposition b) is vastly more valuable. 1 cent multiplied by 2^30 is roughly equals to 10 million USD. But the way the game is presented, <em><strong>our brain is absolutely unable to figure out that proposition b) is worth more than ten times proposition a)</strong></em>.</p>

<p>If the brain has difficulties with exponential growth, but can it work in a linear fashion? It turns out that reality is even worse:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://lithub.com/when-a-man-took-a-joke-in-a-pepsi-ad-seriously-chaos-ensued/">Our brain can only understand logarithmic growth</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Anything else must be inculcated the hard way at school.</p>

<p>A brain built to think in a logarithmic fashion will never be able to compute an exponential growth. At best it might figure out that the result is big. But it will systematically underestimate compound interest. And this is the very reason why good businesses tend to command lower prices than expected.</p>

<h2 id="when-tools-cannot-take-decisions">When tools cannot take decisions</h2>

<p>“Wait a minute,”  would you say. Our brains may be hopeless at understanding compounding, but an analyst’s spreadsheet is not. This is true, but only to the extent that the model in the spreadsheet reflects the reality.</p>

<p>Consider the bread and butter of business valuation, the discounted cash flow analysis.</p>

<p>When elaborating a valuation, the analyst will try to evaluate the future free cash flows of the company, discount them at their present value and sum the total to arrive to a target price.</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues in doing so is to forecast the free cash flow growth in the future. Sure, a business might currently enjoy an attractive growth, but this can mathematically not last forever. Based on many qualitative criteria like the competitive advantage of the company, its position in the industry and its previsibility, the analyst will have to choose how long he expects the company to grow its free cash flows at a high rate. This period is often called the competitive advantage period. What this means is that afterward, the company is expected to grow very little (roughly in line with the GDP growth, or even less). Based on the quality and visibility of the business, the competitve advantage period is usually set between 3 to 10 years in the valuation model.</p>

<p>What is crucial to notice is that the value used for the competitive advantage period has a tremendous impact on the final value of the analysis. Consider a fictitious business currently generating $1’000 of free cash flows and expecting to grow them by 15% annually thanks to some competitive advantage. There will be a time when competition will erode this advantage. Let’s say that this business will only grow 2% per year afterward. For simplicity sake we will use a 10% discounting rate. For simplicity sake as well, the business does not need external capital. All the growth comes from reinvested earnings.</p>

<p>How does the competitive advantage period impacts the value of this business? It turns out that it matters a lot. If the analyst chooses a period of 5 years, the business is worth around $20’000. Had he chosen 10 years, the business value is now  ​USD 31’000.</p>

<p>What happens if instead the business happens to be a wonderful one, growing 15% year after year for 20 years? Its value jumps to $61’000. <em><strong>The valuation tripled due to the variation of a single parameter left to the appreciation of the analyst.</strong></em></p>

<p>I contend that if the company is indeed a  fabulous one, very few analysts will be able to make the call and choose a competitive advantage period that is big enough. The spreadsheet knows how to do the maths, but here the issue is mainly a qualitative one. In an industry where career risk is real, i doubt a lot of analysts would dare to stick their neck out and affirm that a business will enjoy outsized returns for 12, 15, 20 years. This leads systematically to undervaluations. And undervaluation means attractive investment opportunity.</p>

<p>On the one hand, our brains are bad with numbers, but quite good at qualitative analysis. On the other hand, spreadsheets handle natively any calculation, but are terrible at more qualitative matters. Deciding how long a business will enjoy a competitive advantage is one of those. As a result, there is a substantial probability that investors will appraise superior businesses way below their fair value.</p>

<p>I am not saying that these businesses look cheap in any way. For instance, many of Fundsmith’s positions are trading at multiples north of 30 times earnings. But even if the price <em>looks</em> expensive, in many cases it is still a bargain compared to what the underlying business will deliver.  And Buffett has been saying the same for more than thirty years.</p>
