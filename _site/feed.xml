I want to show how wisdom is not intelligence, but a practical ability to navigate through life. I will also discuss how to get progressively wiser, both by personal and vicarious experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wisdom-is-not-the-same-as-intelligence-and-knowledge&quot;&gt;Wisdom is not the same as Intelligence and Knowledge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could think that wisdom and intelligence are the same thing. But that’s not the case! &lt;strong&gt;How many brilliant, intelligent people end up living a miserable and unhappy life?&lt;/strong&gt; Smart people are not spared from divorces, bankruptcy or suicide. The world is full of brilliant persons who made wrong decisions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The French mathematician Évariste Galois laid the foundations of modern mathematics and group theory. He died at 20 in a duel he accepted but knew he would lose.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LTCM was a hedge fund operating in the nineties. Among its staff were two Nobel prizes in economics and the most brilliant bond traders of the time. After a very promising start, the fund hit bankruptcy in a few months because of excessive leverage and self-confidence in its models. The bankruptcy left an indelible stain on the reputation and career of its members, and sometimes led as well to their personal bankruptcy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;David Foster Wallace is one the best writers of the last century. His novel &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt; is universally considered as a masterpiece. His commencement speech &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/&quot;&gt;This is water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has been inspirational for thousands of people. And yet he was unhappy and committed suicide. How come?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if it is not intelligence, what is wisdom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-practical-ability-to-lead-a-good-life&quot;&gt;A practical ability to lead a good life&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The individuals in the previous examples may have been smart and knowledgeable, but they lacked one critical piece of knowledge: how to lead a good life. We see right away that such a piece of knowledge would need to be highly practical. There is no use to theorize the good life and refine it if we are not going to use it during our passage on earth. Thus what we need is a very practical and actionable kind of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pragmatic knowledge of how to live a good life, I call it wisdom. &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom is the practical ability to sail through all the ups and downs we encounter while living.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is what Seneca was writing 2’000 years ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most important knowledge is that which guides the way you lead your life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wisdom-is-sorting-what-is-important-from-what-is-not&quot;&gt;Wisdom is sorting what is important from what is not&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life will throw various experiences at us. As soon as we ask “How do I live a good life?”, other questions arise. How do I know how to live a good life? X is happening to me, is this important?  I am in such-and-such situation, how can I make sure that I get what I want? How do I make the most of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, in a very basic manner, where wisdom intervenes. As Rousseau wrote,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real Wisdom is not the knowledge of everything, but the knowledge of which things in life are necessary, which are less necessary, and which are completely unnecessary to know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wisdom is thus the sorting mechanism by which we keep what is good, useful and important. It discards as well the  harmful, deceitful or useless. This is an emerging result: we continuously learn how the world works, and then we deduce the important levers likely to yield the outcome we seek. Even more important, by becoming wiser we get better at guessing what will lead to the opposite result of what we want - and then avoid it like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, to be wise is to take good decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;understand-how-the-world-works&quot;&gt;Understand how the world works&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to make good decisions, an obvious prerequisite is that we ought to know what are the important factors that are at stake. We are not going to know them if we do not have a good idea of how the world works in the situation at hand. Joseph Tussman wrote it better than anyone else:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What the pupil must learn, if he learns anything at all, is that the world will do most of the work for you, provided you cooperate with it by identifying how it really works and aligning with those realities. If we do not let the world teach us, it teaches us a lesson.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has tremendous implications!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-need-for-rationality&quot;&gt;A need for rationality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first consequence is that we need to be rational. Now matter how the territory of reality is arranged, we have to store in our mind a map that describes correctly this territory. Of course, this is close to impossible: the world is way too complicated to be described exactly in details. But what is often useful to have in mind is a repository of mental models (effective simplifications or beliefs of how the world works). When an event or a fact does not fit with the internal map we have in our brain, it means that our map is not effective at predicting what is going to happen, and our models are erroneous. We need to update these models so that they reflect better reality. The whole process of updating our models and beliefs after being presented with an evidence is the core principle of rationality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very peculiar example of rationality is how Charles Darwin led his whole life. In his autobiography, we can find:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I think that I am superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully, My industry has been nearly as great as it could have been in the observation and collection of facts. What is more important, my love of natural science has been steady and ardent… From my early youth I have had the strongest desire to understand or explain whatever I observed, that is, to group all all facts under some general laws. These causes combined have given me the patience to reflect or ponder for any number of years over any unexplained problem. As far as I can judge, I am not apt to follow blindly the lead of other men.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have steadily endeavoured to keep my mind free so as to give up any hypothesis, however much beloved (and I cannot resist forming one on every subject), as soon as facts are shown to be opposed to it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the posterchild of rationality!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among all the models that are likely to be effective in our quest for wisdom, knowing what influences us is of utmost importance. It would be stupid to know how the rest of the world works, while neglecting how it affects us. This would be a topic in itself, but for the moment I would urge you to document yourself on the subject. In particular, you could do worse than reading the two excellent sources that are [The Psychology of human misjudgment] (by Charlie Munger) and [Influence] (by Robert Cialdini).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;know-when-you-dont-know&quot;&gt;Know when you don’t know&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second consequence is that we should be humble and acknowledge when we don’t know the solution. If wisdom starts by knowing how the world works, we are bound to find ourselves in situations where we have no clue about the principles governing the problem at hand. &lt;strong&gt;As a result, Wisdom is highly domain-related.&lt;/strong&gt; Someone could know exactly what to do in a given context, and produce a disaster in a different setup. How many “smart” people (i.e smart in other domains) have lost meaningful amounts of money in the stock market because they did not understand what would drive their returns? Being smart and lacking humility is often a dangerous cocktail. Mark Twain used to say that “&lt;em&gt;It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an antidote, we should develop a sense of puzzlement when we are in unfamiliar situations. The higher the puzzlement, the more we should try to not be “smart”, but to avoid being stupid (more on that below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stand-on-the-shoulders-of-giants&quot;&gt;Stand on the shoulders of giants&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homo Sapiens has been living on this planet for around 200’000 years. In this time-lapse, the common knowledge acquired has been gigantic. Wisdom is domain related and there is no way that someone could figure out on his own the cumulative wisdom of the entire human species. Nobody is that smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of reproducing the mistakes of others, we should seek to profit from the experiences and lessons learned by others, both living and dead. Books are a fantastic tool for this purpose, but are far from the only one. The popular saying may apply here: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There are three kinds of men. The ones that learn by readin’. The few who learn by observation. The rest of them have to pee on the electric fence for themselves.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  I’m sure you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac Newton is an interesting example. When he confessed that “If he had seen a little bit further, it was by standing on the shoulders of giants”, he simply acknowledged that he benefited from the cumulative intellectual progress done by his predecessors, among whom we find Kepler, Copernicus, Hookes and Descartes. Newton is now buried at Westminster Abbey. On his grave we can read a rather uncommon epitaph: &lt;strong&gt;“Here lies that which was mortal of Sir Isaac Newton”&lt;/strong&gt;. We could do worse than inspiring ourselves from Newton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/isaac-newton-grave.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Newton's epitaph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a recurrence in people who led a good life, you will find that most of them read a lot. According to Descartes, the reading of all good books is like conversation with the finest minds of past centuries. Without doubt these great minds encountered most of the issues we are still dealing with. As students of history we often realize that the wisdom of civilizations is written and forgotten, written and forgotten, written and forgotten. Why should we waste time, resources and often pain to learn what others have been through countless times? &lt;strong&gt;Making friends with the finest minds of the past is for sure a good way to become wiser one step at a time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;invert-always-invert&quot;&gt;Invert, always invert&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not want to write this essay without talking about inversion.
In every situation we face, there are often more than one way to find a solution. Most of the time we reflect on the current problematic situation, look at where we would like to go, and figure out a bridge from the former to the latter. This may work, but life is often complicated. The devised solution often end up being even more complicated, and not fool-proof to side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another way however. The unintuitive path is called &lt;strong&gt;inversion&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of trying to solve the problem in a direct manner, we should try to think about all the ways in which we would be sure to fail lamentably, &lt;em&gt;and then make sure we never do that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you are an honest politician trying to help the economy of your country. Framed in this manner, the universe of solutions seems endless and choosing one over the other does not seem to guarantee effectiveness nor any result. But if you start by asking “How could I ruin for sure the economy of my country?”, you will eliminate swiftly many spaces of strategies and ensure that whatever you do, you will not hurt your country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We just turn the problem backwards.&lt;/strong&gt; This mindset was put forward by the german mathematician Carl Jacobi, but nobody has been a stronger proponent than Charlie Munger, the sidekick of Warren Buffett.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munger likes to tell the story of the simple rustic who used to say “All i want to know is where i am going to die so i will never go there”. You may smile at the rustic, but there is a lot of wisdom in applying this maxim in our day-to-day lives.
If wisdom is defined as knowing what to do in a given situation, he who knows what not to do under any circumstances is must have acquired some kind of wisdom. Munger has applied this his whole life. As he likes to say,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immense power of this mindset is that it simply prevents us to run into problems. Knowing what to do  is often knowing how not to worsen our situation. Seen under this lens, wisdom becomes synonymous with prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wise man will seek to avoid problems in the first place, rather than trying to solve them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we are stuck into a problem, we are never sure to get out of it. By avoiding it from the very beginning we make sure we will come out unscathed, and that adds to our tranquility of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an ironic twist of events that society celebrates so much problem solvers. Problem-avoiders end up  invisible. Newspapers will make headlines on heroes who saved people lives in a fire, but will never mention the other hero who prevented the fire in the first place. That never makes a good movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wisdom framed as problem-avoidance looks unsexy and boring. But it for sure makes us live better lives!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being smart is not a guarantee to live a good life, as so many intelligent people have found out. What we need is a practical knowledge to help us navigate through life and know what to do in many situations. This practical, actionable knowledge is what we commonly call wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to know what to do, we should know how the world works. This way we are able to distinguish the levers that will help us in a given context.  Learning about the world’s inner gears can be done either by direct or vicarious experience. But since the cumulative wisdom of our civilization is so wide, learning through others will accelerate our learning curve!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a final note, knowing what to do is as important as knowing what &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to do. The inversion principle is a powerful tool allowing us to get rid of many solutions that were not obviously harmful at first sight…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>julien</name></author><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">This blog is all about getting wiser and living a good life, so it high time that we discuss in details what I mean by wisdom.

As I explained in &lt;a href=&quot;/Your-Brain-101-Part-2&quot;&gt;Your Brain 101&lt;/a&gt;, our cognition can be the target of many biases, and has a limited capacity to focus. You want to make sure this capacity is put to a good use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among all the actions you could take to improve your environment, one of the most effective is to simply avoid the news. Nobody has written better about it than author Rolf Dobelli. Therefore, I want to share his essay “Avoid News” in its integrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;avoid-news&quot;&gt;Avoid News&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;towards-a-healthy-news-diet&quot;&gt;Towards a Healthy News Diet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Rolf Dobelli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prologue&quot;&gt;Prologue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is the antidote to news. It is long, and you probably won’t be able to skim it. Thanks to heavy news consumption, many people have lost the reading habit and struggle to absorb more than four pages straight. This article will show you how to get out of this trap – if you are not already too deeply in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news-is-to-the-mind-what-sugar-is-to-the-body&quot;&gt;News is to the mind what sugar is to the body&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are so well informed and yet we know so little. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in this sad condition because 200 years ago we invented a toxic form of knowledge called “news.” The time has come to recognize the detrimental effects that news has on individuals and societies, and to take the necessary steps to shield yourself from its dangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At core, human beings are cavemen in suits and dresses. Our brains are optimized for our original hunter-gatherer environment where we lived in small bands of 25 to 100 individuals with limited sources of food and information. Our brains (and our bodies) now live in a world that is the opposite of what we are designed to handle. This leads to great risk and to inappropriate, outright dangerous behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few decades, the fortunate among us have recognized the hazards of living with an overabundance of food (obesity, diabetes) and have started to shift our diets. But most of us do not yet understand that news is to the mind what sugar is to the body. News is easy to digest. The media feeds us small bites of trivial matter, tidbits that don’t really concern our lives and don’t require thinking. That’s why we experience almost no saturation. Unlike reading books and long, deep magazine articles (which requires thinking), we can swallow limitless quantities of news flashes, like bright-colored candies for the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we have reached the same point in relation to information overload that we faced 20 years ago in regard to food intake. We are beginning to recognize how toxic news can be and we are learning to take the first steps toward an information diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my attempt to clarify the toxic dangers of news – and to recommend some ways to deal with it. I have now gone without news for a year, so I can see, feel and report the effects of this freedom first hand: less disruption, more time, less anxiety, deeper thinking, more insights. It’s not easy, but it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My good friend Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of The Black Swan, was one of the first people to recognize news consumption as a serious problem. I owe many of the following insights to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-1--news-misleads-us-systematically&quot;&gt;No 1 – News misleads us systematically&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News reports do not represent the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our brains are wired to pay attention to visible, large, scandalous, sensational, shocking, peoplerelated, story-formatted, fast changing, loud, graphic onslaughts of stimuli. Our brains have limited attention to spend on more subtle pieces of intelligence that are small, abstract, ambivalent, complex, slow to develop and quiet, much less silent. News organizations systematically exploit this bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News media outlets, by and large, focus on the highly visible. They display whatever information they can convey with gripping stories and lurid pictures, and they systematically ignore the subtle and insidious, even if that material is more important. News grabs our attention; that’s how its business model works. Even if the advertising model didn’t exist, we would still soak up news pieces because they are easy to digest and superficially quite tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highly visible misleads us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the following event. A car drives over a bridge, and the bridge collapses. What does the news media focus on? On the car. On the person in the car. Where he came from. Where he planned to go. How he experienced the crash (if he survived). What kind of person he is (was). But – that is all completely irrelevant. What’s relevant? The structural stability of the bridge. That’s the underlying risk that has been lurking and could lurk in other bridges. That is the lesson to be learned from this event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car doesn’t matter at all. Any car could have caused the bridge to collapse. It could have been a strong wind or a dog walking over the bridge. So, why does the media cover the car? Because it’s flashy, it’s dramatic, it’s a person (non-abstract), and it’s news that’s cheap to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of news, we walk around with the completely wrong risk map in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Terrorism is overrated. Chronic stress is underrated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The collapse of Lehman Brothers is overrated. Fiscal irresponsibility is underrated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Astronauts are overrated. Nurses are underrated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Britney Spears is overrated. IPCC reports are underrated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Airplane crashes are overrated. Resistance to antibiotics is underrated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not rational enough to be exposed to the news-mongering press. It is a very dangerous thing, because the probabilistic mapping we get from consuming news is entirely different from the actual risks that we face. Watching an airplane crash on television is going to change your attitude toward that risk regardless of its real probability, no matter your intellectual sophistication. If you think you can compensate for this bias with the strength of your own inner contemplation, you are wrong. Bankers and economists – who have powerful incentives to compensate for newsborne hazards – have shown that they cannot. The only solution: cut yourself off from news consumption entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-2--news-is-irrelevant&quot;&gt;No 2 – News is irrelevant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the approximately 10,000 news stories you have read in the last 12 months, name one that – because you consumed it – allowed you to make a better decision about a serious matter affecting your life, your career, your business – compared to what you would have known if you hadn’t swallowed that morsel of news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is: the consumption of news is irrelevant to the forces that really matter in your life. At its best, it is entertaining, but it is still irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume that, against all odds, you found one piece of news that substantially increased the quality of your life – compared to how your life would have unfolded if you hadn’t read or seen it. How much trivia did your brain have to digest to get to that one relevant nugget? Even that question is a hindsight analysis. Looking forward, we can’t possibly identify the value of a piece of news before we see it, so we are forced to digest everything on the news buffet line. Is that worthwhile? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1914, the news story about the assassination in Sarajevo dwarfed all other reports in terms of its global significance. But, the murder in Sarajevo was just one of several thousand stories in circulation that day. No news organization treated this historically pivotal homicide as anything more than just another politically inspired assassination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Internet browser debuted in 1995. The public birth of this hugely relevant piece of software barely made it into the press despite its vast future impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People find it very difficult to recognize what’s relevant. It’s much easier to recognize what’s new. We are not equipped with sensory organs for relevance. Relevance doesn’t come naturally. News does. That’s why the media plays on the new. (If our minds were structured the other way round, the media would certainly play on the relevant.) The relevant versus the new is the fundamental battle of the modern man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News floods you with a worldview that is not relevant to your life. What does relevance mean? It means: what is important to you personally. Relevance is a personal choice. Don’t take the media’s view for it. To the media, any tale that sells lots of copies is relevant – Darfur, Paris Hilton, a train crash in China, some idiotic world record (like someone who ate 78 cheeseburgers in an hour). This swindle is at the core of the news industry’s business model. It sells the relevant, but delivers the new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media organizations want you to believe that news offers individuals some sort of a competitive advantage. Many people fall for that. We get anxious when we’re cut off from the flow of news. We fear we’re missing something important. In reality, news consumption is a competitive disadvantage. The less news you consume the bigger the advantage you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afraid you will miss “something important”? From my experience, if something really important happens, you will hear about it, even if you live in a cocoon that protects you from the news. Friends and colleagues will tell you about relevant events far more reliably than any news organization. They will fill you in with the added benefit of metainformation, since they know your priorities and you know how they think. You will learn far more about really important events and societal shifts by reading about them in specialized journals, indepth magazines or good books and by talking to the people who know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-3--news-limits-understanding&quot;&gt;No 3 – News limits understanding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News has no explanatory power. News items are little bubbles popping on the surface of a deeper world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News organizations pride themselves on correctly reporting the facts, but the facts that they prize are just epiphenomena of deeper causes. Both news organizations and news consumers mistake knowing a litany of facts for understanding the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not “news facts” that are important, but the threads that connect them. What we really want is to understand the underlying processes, how things happen. Unfortunately, precariously few news organizations manage to explain causation because the underlying processes that govern significant social, political and environmental movements mostly are invisible. They are complex, non-linear and hard for our (and the journalists’) brains to digest. Why do news organizations go for the light stuff, the anecdotes, scandals, people-stories and pictures? The answer is simple: because they are cheap to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important stories are non-stories: slow, powerful movements that develop below the journalists’ radar but have a transforming effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people believe that having more information helps them make better decisions. News organizations support this belief. Hell, it’s in their interest. Will accumulating facts help you understand the world? Sadly, no. The relationship is actually inverted. The more “news factoids” you digest, the less of the big picture you will understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No evidence exists to indicate that information junkies are better decision makers. They are certainly not more successful than the average Joe. If more information leads to higher economic success, we would expect journalists to be at the top of the pyramid. That’s not the case. Quite the contrary. We don’t know what makes people successful, but amassing news tidbits is certainly not it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading news to understand the world is worse than not reading anything. What’s best: cut yourself off from daily news consumption entirely. Read books and thoughtful journals instead of gulping down flashing headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-4--news-is-toxic-to-your-body&quot;&gt;No 4 – News is toxic to your body&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News constantly triggers the limbic system. Panicky stories spur the release of cascades of glucocordicoid (cortisol). This deregulates your immune system and inhibits the release of growth hormones. In other words, your body finds itself in a state of chronic stress. High glucocordicoid levels cause impaired digestion, lack of growth (cell, hair, bone), nervousness and susceptibility to infections. News consumers risk impairing their physical health. The other potential side effects of news include fear, aggression, tunnel-vision and desensitization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-5--news-massively-increases-cognitive-errors&quot;&gt;No 5 – News massively increases cognitive errors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News feeds the mother of all cognitive errors: confirmation bias. We automatically, systematically filter out evidence that contradicts our preconceptions in favor of evidence that confirms our beliefs. In the words of Warren Buffett: “What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.” That is the confirmation bias. News consumption, especially customized news intake, exacerbates this human flaw. The result is that we walk around in a cloud of seemingly confirming data – even when our theories about the world and ourselves may be wrong. We become prone to overconfidence, take stupid risks and misjudge opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News not only feeds the confirmation bias, it exacerbates another cognitive error: the story bias. Our brains crave stories that “make sense” – even if they don’t correspond to reality. And news organizations are happy to deliver those fake stories. Instead of just reporting that the stock market declined (or increased) by 2%, TV news anchors proclaim, “The market declined by 2% because of X.” This X could be a bank profit forecast, fear about the Euro, non-farm payroll statistics, a Fed decision, a terrorist attack in Madrid, a subway strike in New York, a handshake between two presidents, anything, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of high school. My history textbook specified seven reasons (not six, not eight) why the French Revolution erupted. The fact is, we don’t know why the French Revolution broke out. And especially not why it exploded specifically in 1789. And we don’t know why the stock market moves as it moves. Too many factors go into such shifts. We don’t know why a war breaks out, a technological breakthrough is achieved or why the oil price jumps. Any journalist who writes, “The market moved because of X” or “the company went bankrupt because of Y” is an idiot. Of course, X might have had a casual influence, but it’s far from established, and other influences may be much more meaningful. To a large degree, news reports consist of nothing but stories and anecdotes that end up substituting for coherent analyses. I am fed up with this cheap way of “explaining” the world. It’s inappropriate. It’s irrational. It’s forgery. And I refuse to let it contaminate my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-6--news-inhibits-thinking&quot;&gt;No 6 – News inhibits thinking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking requires concentration. Concentration requires uninterrupted time. News items are like free-floating radicals that interfere with clear thinking. News pieces are specifically engineered to interrupt you. They are like viruses that steal attention for their own purposes. This is not about stealing time (see reason 8). This is about the inability to think clearly because you have opened yourself up to the disruptive factoid stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News makes us shallow thinkers. But it’s worse than that. News severely affects memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of memory. Long-range memory’s capacity is nearly infinite, but working memory is limited to a minimum amount of slippery data (try repeating a 10-digit phone number after you hear it for the first time). The path from short-term to long-term memory is a choke-point in the brain, but anything you want to understand must past through it. If this passageway is disrupted, nothing passes through. Because news disrupts concentration, it actively weakens comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t visit Paris for just one hour or speed through the Museum of Modern Art in two minutes. Why not? Because the brain needs spoolup time. Building up concentration takes a minimum of a 10-minute read. Given less time, your brain will process the information superficially and barely store it. News pieces are like wind hitting your cheek. Ask yourself: What are the top ten news items from a month ago (that are no longer in the news today)? If you have a hard time remembering, you are not alone. Why would you want to consume something that doesn’t add to your body of knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online news has an even worse impact. In a 2001 study1 two scholars in Canada showed that comprehension declines as the number of hyperlinks in a document increase. Why? Because whenever a link appears, your brain has to at least make the choice not to click, which in itself is distracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News consumers are suckers for irrelevancy, and online news consumers are the biggest suckers. News is an interruption system. It seizes your attention only to scramble it. Besides a lack of glucose in your blood stream, news distraction is the biggest barricade to clear thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-7--news-changes-the-structure-of-your-brain&quot;&gt;No 7 – News changes the structure of your brain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News works like a drug. As stories develop, we naturally want to know how they continue. With hundreds of arbitrary story lines in our heads, this craving is increasingly compelling and hard to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is news addictive? Once you get into the habit of checking the news, you are driven to check it even more often. Your attention is set on fast-breaking events, so you hunger for more data about them. This has to do with a process called “long-term potentiation” (LTP) and the reward circuits in your brain. Addicts seek more of an addictive substance to get their fix, because they need more stimulation than non-addicts to reach a satisfying reward threshold. If you set your attention on other things – like literature, science, art, history, cooking, pet grooming, whatever – you will become more focused on those things. That’s just how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science used to think that our brain, the dense connections formed among the 100 billion neurons inside our skulls, was largely fixed by the time we reached adulthood. Today we know that this is not the case. The human brain is highly plastic. Nerve cells routinely break old connections and form new ones. When we adapt to a new cultural phenomenon, including the consumption of news, we end up with a different brain. Adaptation to news occurs at a biological level. News reprograms us. That means our brain works differently even when we’re not consuming news. And that’s dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more news we consume, the more we exercise the neural circuits devoted to skimming and multitasking while ignoring those used for reading deeply and thinking with profound focus. Most news consumers – even if they used to be avid book readers – have lost the ability to read and absorb lengthy articles or books. After four, five pages they get tired, their concentration vanishes, they become restless. It’s not because they got older or their schedules became more onerous. It’s because the physical structure of their brains has changed. In the words of Professor Michael Merzenich (University of California, San Francisco), a pioneer in the field of neuroplasticity: “We are training our brains to pay attention to the crap.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep reading is indistinguishable from deep thinking. When you consume news, your brain structurally changes. This means that the way you think changes. Regaining the capacity for concentration and contemplation will take nothing less than a radical news-free diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-8--news-is-costly&quot;&gt;No 8 – News is costly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News wastes time. It exacts exorbitant costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News taxes productivity three ways. First, count the consumption-time that news demands. That’s the time you actually waste reading, listening to or watching the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, tally up the refocusing time – or switching cost. That’s the time you waste trying to get back to what you were doing before the news interrupted you. You have to collect your thoughts. What were you about to do? Every time you disrupt your work to check the news, reorienting yourself wastes more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, news distracts us even hours after we’ve digested today’s hot items. News stories and images may pop into your mind hours, sometimes days later, constantly interrupting your train of thought. Why would you want to do that to yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read the newspaper for 15 minutes each morning, then check the news for 15 minutes during lunch and 15 minutes before you go to bed, you’re eating substantial time. Then, add five minutes here and there when you’re at work, plus distraction and refocusing time. You will lose productive hours totaling at least half a day every week. Half a day – and for what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a global level, the loss in potential productivity is huge. Take the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai, where terrorists murdered some 200 people in an act of chilling exhibitionism. Imagine that a billion people devoted, on average, one hour of their attention to the Mumbai tragedy: following the news, watching some talking head on TV, thinking about it. The number is a wild guess, but the guess is far from a wild number. India, alone, has more than a billion people. Many of them spent whole days following the drama. One billion people times one hour is one billion hours, which is more than 100,000 years. The global average life expectancy is today 66 years. So nearly 2,000 lives were swallowed by news consumption. It’s far more than the number of people murdered. In a sense, the newscasters became unwilling bedfellows of the terrorists. At least the Mumbai attacks had actual impact. Look at the hours lost when Michael Jackson died – no real content in the stories, and millions of hours wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is no longer a scarce commodity. But attention is. Why give it away so easily? You are not that irresponsible with your money, your reputation or your health. Why give away your mind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-9--news-sunders-the-relationship-between-reputation-and-achievement&quot;&gt;No 9 – News sunders the relationship between reputation and achievement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reputation affects how people cooperate in society. In our ancestral past, a person’s reputation was directly linked to his or her achievements. You saw that your fellow tribe member killed a tiger single handedly and you spread word of his bravery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of mass-produced news, the strange concept of “fame” entered our society. Fame is misleading because generally people become famous for reasons that have little relevance to our lives. The media grants fame to movie stars and news anchors for scant reason. News sunders the relationship between reputation and achievement. The tragedy is that pop notoriety crowds out the achievements of those who make more substantive contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-10--news-is-produced-by-journalists&quot;&gt;No 10 – News is produced by journalists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good professional journalists take time with their stories, authenticate their facts and try to think things through. But like any profession, journalism has some incompetent, unfair practitioners who don’t have the time – or the capacity – for deep analysis. You might not be able to tell the difference between a polished professional report and a rushed, glib, paid-by-the-piece article by a writer with an ax to grind. It all looks like news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My estimate: fewer than 10% of the news stories are original. Less than 1% are truly investigative. And only once every 50 years do journalists uncover a Watergate. Many reporters cobble together the rest of the news from other people’s reports, common knowledge, shallow thinking and whatever the journalist can find on the internet. Some reporters copy from each other or refer to old pieces, without necessarily catching up with any interim corrections. The copying and the copying of the copies multiply the flaws in the stories and their irrelevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-11--reported-facts-are-sometimes-wrong-forecasts-always&quot;&gt;No 11 – Reported facts are sometimes wrong, forecasts always&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, reported facts are simply mistaken. With reduced editorial budgets at major publications, fact checking may be an endangered step in the news process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Yorker magazine is legendary for its fact checking. The story goes that when an article mentioned the Empire State Building, someone from the fact-checking department would go out and visually verify that, in fact, the building was still standing. I don’t know if the story is true, but it highlights a point. Today, the fact checker is an endangered species at most news companies (though still alive and well at The New Yorker).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many news stories include predictions, but accurately predicting anything in a complex world is impossible. Overwhelming evidence indicates that forecasts by journalists and by experts in finance, social development, global conflicts and technology are almost always completely wrong. So, why consume that junk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did the newspapers predict World War I, the Great Depression, the sexual revolution, the fall of the Soviet empire, the rise of the Internet, resistance to antibiotics, the fall of Europe’s birth rate or the explosion in depression cases? Maybe, you’d find one or two correct predictions in a sea of millions of mistaken ones. Incorrect forecast are not only useless, they are harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase the accuracy of your predictions, cut out the news and roll the dice or, if you are ready for depth, read books and knowledgeable journals to understand the invisible generators that affect our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-12--news-is-manipulative&quot;&gt;No 12 – News is manipulative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our evolutionary past has equipped us with a good bullshit detector for face-to-face interactions. We automatically use many clues to detect manipulation, clues that go beyond the verbal message and include gesture, facial expression, and signs of nervousness such as sweaty palms, blushing and body odor. Living in small bands of people, we almost always knew the background of the messenger. Information always came with a rich set of meta-data. Today, even conscientious readers find that distinguishing even-handed news stories from ones that have a private agenda is difficult and energy consuming. Why go through that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories are selected or slanted to please advertisers (advertising bias) or the owners of the media (corporate bias), and each media outlet has a tendency to report what everyone else is reporting, and to avoid stories that will offend anyone (mainstream bias).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public relations (PR) industry is as large as the news reporting industry – the best proof that journalists and news organizations can be manipulated, or at least influenced or swayed. Corporations, interest groups and other organizations would not expend such huge sums on PR if it didn’t work. If spinmeisters can manipulate journalists, who have a natural skepticism toward powerful organizations, what makes you think you can escape their trickery?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the Nurse Nayirah story. Nayirah was a 15- year-old Kuwaiti girl who testified to the U.S. Congress during the run up to the 1991 Gulf War. She alleged that she had witnessed the murder of infant children by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait. Virtually every media outlet covered the story. The U.S. public was outraged, which in turn pushed Congress closer to approving the war. Her testimony, which all media outlets regarded as credible at the time, has since come to be regarded as wartime propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalism shapes a common picture of the world and a common set of narratives for discussing it. It sets the public agenda. Hold on: do we really want news reporters to set the public agenda? I believe that agenda setting by the media is just bad democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-13--news-makes-us-passive&quot;&gt;No 13 – News makes us passive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News stories are overwhelmingly about things you cannot influence. This sets readers up to have a fatalistic outlook on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this with our ancestral past, where you could act upon practically every bit of news. Our evolutionary past prepared us to act on information, but the daily repetition of news about things we can’t act upon makes us passive. It saps our energy. It grinds us down until we adopt a worldview that is pessimistic, desensitized, sarcastic and fatalistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the human brain encounters a barrage of ambiguous information without being able to act upon that information, it can react with passivity and a sense of victimhood. The scientific term is learned helplessness. It’s a bit of a stretch, but I would not be surprised if news consumption at least partially contributes to the widespread disease of depression. Viewed on a timeline, the spread of depression coincides almost perfectly with the growth and maturity of the mass media. Maybe it’s a coincidence, or maybe the constant onslaught of fire, famine, flood and failure adds to depression, even if these sad reports come from far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;14--news-gives-us-the-illusion-of-caring&quot;&gt;14 – News gives us the illusion of caring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Norris (even if I don’t share most of her ideas) said it best: “We may want to believe that we are still concerned, as our eyes drift from a news anchor announcing the latest atrocity to the NBA scores and stock market quotes streaming across the bottom of the screen. But the ceaseless bombardment of image and verbiage makes us impervious to caring.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News wraps us in a warm global feeling. We are all world citizens. We are all connected. The planet is just one global village. We sing “We Are the World” and wave the little flame of our lighters in perfect harmony with thousands of others. This gives us a glowing, fuzzy feeling that delivers the illusion of caring but doesn’t get us anywhere. This allure of anything bespeaking global brotherhood smells like a gigantic chimera. The fact is, consuming news does not make us more connected to each other. We are connected because we interact and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-15--news-kills-creativity&quot;&gt;No 15 – News kills creativity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things we already know limit our creativity. This is one reason that mathematicians, novelists, composers and entrepreneurs often produce their most creative works at a young age. They are oblivious to much that has been tried before. Their brains enjoy a wide, uninhabited space that emboldens them to come up with and pursue novel ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know a single truly creative mind who is a news junkie – not a writer, not a composer, mathematician, physician, scientist, musician, designer, architect or painter. On the other hand, I know a whole bunch of viciously uncreative minds who consume news like drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creativity-killing effect of news might also be due to something simpler we’ve discussed before: distraction. I just can’t imagine producing novel ideas with the distraction that news always delivers. If you want to come up with old solutions, read news. If you are looking for new solutions, don’t read news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-do-instead&quot;&gt;What to do instead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go without news. Cut it out completely. Go cold turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make news as inaccessible as possible. Delete the news apps from your iPhone. Sell your TV. Cancel your newspaper subscriptions. Do not pick up newspapers and magazines that lie around in airports and train stations. Do not set your browser default to a news site. Pick a site that never changes. The more stale the better. Delete all news sites from your browser’s favorites list. Delete the news widgets from your desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep the illusion of “not missing anything important”, I suggest you glance through the summary page of the Economist once a week. Don’t spend more than five minutes on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read magazines and books which explain the world – Science, Nature, The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly. Go for magazines that connect the dots and don’t shy away from presenting the complexities of life – or from purely entertaining you. The world is complicated, and we can do nothing about it. So, you must read longish and deep articles and books that represent its complexity. Try reading a book a week. Better two or three. History is good. Biology. Psychology. That way you’ll learn to understand the underlying mechanisms of the world. Go deep instead of broad. Enjoy material that truly interests you. Have fun reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first week will be the hardest. Deciding not to check the news while you are thinking, writing or reading takes discipline. You are fighting your brain’s built-in tendency. Initially, you will feel out of touch or even socially isolated. Every day you will be tempted to check your favorite news Website. Don’t do it. Stick to the cold-turkey plan. Go 30 days without news. After 30 days, you will have a more relaxed attitude toward the news. You will find that you have more time, more concentration and a better understanding of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, you will realize that despite your personal news blackout, you have not missed – and you’re not going to miss – any important facts. If some bit of information is truly important to your profession, your company, your family or your community, you will hear it in time – from your friends, your mother-in-law or whomever you talk to or see. When you are with your friends, ask them if anything important is happening in the world. The question is a great conversation starter. Most of the time, the answer will be: “not really.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you afraid that living a news-free existence will make you an outcast at parties? Well, you might not know that Lindsay Lohan went to jail, but you will have more intelligent facts to share – about the cultural meaning of the food you are eating or the discovery of exosolar planets. Never be shy about discussing your news diet. People will be fascinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;good-news&quot;&gt;Good News&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Society needs journalism – but in a different way. Investigative journalism is relevant in any society. We need more hard-core journalists digging into meaningful stories. We need reporting that polices our society and uncovers the truth. The best example is Watergate. But important findings don’t have to arrive in the form of news. Often, reporting is not time sensitive. Long journal articles and in-depth books are fine forums for investigative journalism – and now that you’ve gone cold turkey on the news, you’ll have time to read them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>julien</name></author><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">Our brain is highly sensible to its environment.

In the last part, &lt;a href=&quot;/Your-Brain-101-Part-1&quot;&gt;we saw how neurons work and how they interact&lt;/a&gt;. We also so a model of how they are organized in three “layers” in the brain.
In this part I want to present the works of Nobel Prize laureate Daniel Kahneman and the late Amos Tversky. They have shown that our brain often behaves as if two agents with wildly differing characteristics were in control. Most of what I will talk about is sourced from the excellent book &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt; by Daniel Kahneman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;two-modes-of-thoughts&quot;&gt;Two modes of thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often believe that we know what is going on in our mind. We experience one thought, which leads to another one in a logical manner, and so on. We would even be aware of all our thoughts. But this is only one type of thinking happening into our brain, and not even the most common one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove his point, Kahneman takes the example of the below picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Angry.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;angry&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Source: Thinking, fast and slow, Daniel Kahneman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatically, our brain has picked up a lot of small cues from the face of the woman to know that she is angry, and that she is likely to yell not very nice things to us. This happened effortlessly, without you trying conscientiously to actively decipher the mood of the woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now solve the following multiplication:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17 * 24&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will notice that your mental experience is vastly different. First, the result did not come automatically to you.  You are allocated a lot of conscious effort to perform the calculus, in a slow, organized and methodic way. It is likely you stopped everything you were doing to solve the multiplication. &lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how Kahneman introduces the concept of two agents, System 1 and System 2, who are the principal characters of our mental life. System 1 is responsible for “fast” thinking (as happened with the angry woman), while System 2 handles Slow, deliberate thinking (the multiplication example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;system-1-fast-automatic-thinking&quot;&gt;System 1: Fast, automatic thinking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you saw the woman above, your System 1 took over to process all the information given by the situation (duh, she looks very angry! I bet she is not going to be nice to me…). System 1 operates automatically, quickly and effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we cannot have any control over it. When looking at the woman, we could not “not see” on purpose that she is angry. Even if we order our brain to ignore the woman, it will figure out her mood anyway.  We have no control over System 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kahneman gives a list of activities that are typically performed by System 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;detect that one object is more distant than another&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;orient to the source of a sudden sound&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;detect hostility in a voice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Answer to “2 + 2 = ?”  (simple math question)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make pattern associations, like figuring out that a “meek and tidy soul with a passion for detail” fits more the character of a librarian than ta farmer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these tasks require no effort, they are performed routinely by System 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drawback of System 1 is that it cannot be turned off. Whatever happens to you, it will continuously process its environment on the fly. If you see a word on a billboard that you already know, you will read it, unless your attention is totally depleted (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;system-2-slow-deliberate-thinking&quot;&gt;System 2: Slow, deliberate thinking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes the laborious System 2. When we think of ourselves, this is the system we have in mind. System 2 handles effortful mental activities like complex computations or problem solving. We often think of System 2 as the part of our brain responsible for agency, choice and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common point of all activities performed by System 2 is that they require attention. Draw away the attention, and they get badly disrupted. Kahneman gives another list of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on the voice of a particular person in a noisy room in a party&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember a phone number&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Park in a narrow space&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fill out a tax form&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the validity of a complex logical argument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An outstanding feature of System 2 is that the more cognitively demanding a task is, the less attention we are going to pay to anything else, until we become blind to our environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may already know the below video. If you don’t, good. In a now famous experiment done by Chabris and Simons, the two researchers created a short film showing two teams playing basketball. One team wears white t-shirts, while the other teams wears black t-shirts. In the experiment, the viewer of the video were asked count how many passes the white team would make. In a normal setting, this task is totally absorbing and cognitively demanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vJG698U2Mvo?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thousands viewed the video, but only half of them noticed the gorilla while counting the passes. And the gorilla was present in the movie for nine full seconds! It is not an exaggeration to state that cognitively difficult tasks can blind us to our environment…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phenomena happens as well in what we call &lt;em&gt;ego depletion&lt;/em&gt; : suppose you have to perform a cognitive - heavy task like remembering 7 numbers in your memory for several minutes. After the task is realized, you could believe that your mind is ready to tackle any new cognitive challenge. But studies revealed that as long as your mind is not rested, if any other difficult task arise (like choosing between a healthy salad and a caloric cookie), your System 2 will not be able to perform at its maximum capacity: it is very likely that you will indulge on the cookie. Cognitive performance is a limited resource, and as such the brain cannot be strained 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has a big consequence on your will and self-control: those are tiring activities, and &lt;strong&gt;I guarantee you that having to control yourself all the time is doomed to fail at some point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-lazy-controller&quot;&gt;A lazy controller&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we know that System 2 cannot always continuously perform difficult tasks. In fact, most of the time it will prefer low-efforts tasks. It is a recurring theme of nature that the path-of-least-effort gets often rewarded, and System 2 is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System 2 is an enormous consumer of glucose. It looks like “cognitively demanding” is actually a synonym for “energy demanding”, as researchers have monitored the amount of glucose the brain consumes, and figured out that its cognition performed better when the glucose levels in the human body where restored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many systems in nature, System 2 is energy efficient: if it can escape a demanding effort, it will. Therefore, most of the time it will be engaged in a low effort mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we become skilled in a task, the connections within the brain get reinforced and System 2 will consume less and less energy to perform the task. At some point, it will become totally automatic and get transferred to System 1. That’s what happens when we learn how to walk: a baby has to focus intensely when performing his first steps, but for an adult it is a second nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-the-two-systems-interact&quot;&gt;How do the two Systems interact?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have presented them in a separate manner, there is no reason to think the the two systems operate separately. Both Systems are always on, provided we are awake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their binomial setup, System 1 will continuously generate ideas for System 2: ideas, impressions, intentions, feelings. &lt;strong&gt;If they get validated by System 2, these impressions are then transformed into beliefs, upon which we take action if needed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this goes smoothly most of the time. System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1, and all is well in the best of the worlds, because most of the time we believe our impressions. Not doing so would be excruciating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as soon as System 1 runs into difficulties, it will call System 2 to comes to the rescue. The multiplication above is a good example. System 1 is incapable of processing tasks in an organized way, so when it needs to do so it will outsource the task to System 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trigger for outsourcing is when System 1 notices something unusual or which runs into conflict with its model of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a cat barks or a gorilla crosses a basketball court, System 1 will get confused enough to call System 2 for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a basic understanding of how the two systems interact. Most of the time, System 1 is actually doing all the work and its suggestions are stamped as “approved” by System 2. It is only when System 1 is overwhelmed that System 2 will take over and do the leg work. But as we have also seen, System 2 can be lazy. Sometimes, it will not control what System 1 generated and just accept it “as is”. This is often the cause of many cognitive errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, let’s not be to alarmist: this arrangement works well in most situations! This quick and “economic” structure is very efficient from an evolution point of view and there is no doubt that it gave us many advantages over other species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s sum up what we know so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System 1 is the automatic ideas, associations and links generator, and System 2 is the validator, able to organize itself to come to a conclusion.  System 1 is intuitive and impulsive, while System 2 is capable of reasoning and being cautious, while sometimes being lazy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since System 1 is so important to how our mind works, let’s dig deeper to see some of its additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-associative-machine&quot;&gt;The Associative Machine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that System 1 works automatically and effortlessly, but what does it do exactly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Associations. System 1 works mainly by making associations. Neurons fired by System 1 will trigger other neurons that are linked to it. All those neurons have the common point of being somehow related because they represent related concepts. These neurons themselves trigger other neurons linked to yet other related concepts, and so on in a snowball effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each idea is connected to other ideas as long as they are coherent between themselves. An element will strengthen related coherent elements, supported by the architecture of underlying neuronal connections. A word can elicit memories, that trigger emotions, movements and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole process is called associative activation: provided that there is some relatedness between two concepts, the activation of one concept will surely activate the other. An activated idea does not merely activate one another idea, but many others, which in turn activate in cascade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of this happens without us even being aware of it! System 2 may focus on one or two elements activated by System 1, but System 1 is working relentlessly to generate new associations as soon as an idea is triggered. Only a few of the activated ideas will register in consciousness; most of the associative work is silent and below the radar or our conscious selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kahneman gives the example of the two following words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bananas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vomit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although in general the two terms are unrelated, as soon as they are read System 1 cannot refrain from generating associations that could link the two words. Especially, the mind will create automatically a temporal sequence - without being told so - where the fruits caused the sickness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same time, a small feeling of disgust was triggered, the body tensed and the heart rate increased… It is as if the whole body had experienced a lesser intensity version of the story, just by reading those two words! Without us being aware, System 1 has generated all the elements, ideas, emotions and actions where those two juxtaposed words made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would System 1 do that? Because in most cases, it is very helpful and efficient! Imagine a machine that in the majority of situations can induce the context of any situation by looking at a few elements. That is exactly what System 1 did here! It informs us about the past and prepare us for the future. All of this with the very few elements available (here, only two words!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This associative machine leads us to the psychological concept of &lt;em&gt;priming&lt;/em&gt;. As activated ideas trigger other ideas, beliefs, emotions and behaviors, we could expect that we could make people more receptive to other ideas by activating related concepts. And this is exactly what experiences show…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subjects having seen the word “Wash” are more likely to guess “SOAP” when seeing “SO_P”. Other subjects having seen “Eat” will instead fill “SO_P” with SOUP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making people more receptive to one concept by showing them related concepts is called &lt;em&gt;priming&lt;/em&gt;. For example, subjects primed with money-related concepts reported a more independent mindset as well as a more pronounced problem solving attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all sounds frightening. We all have in mind scenarios where evil marketers or snake oil salesmen could use some variants of priming to make us more receptive to their scam products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it happens in reality, we have to realize that absolutely &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; primes us. By reading the above paragraph, you have been primed with concepts related to scams, and surely you experienced a bit of disgust and thought of other occasions where scammers tried to get your money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely everything primes us then, and this is why it is very important to take care of the environment surrounding us. It is easy to get primed by factors we would like to avoid, so they should not enter our life in the first place. In particular (and I will talk a lot about it on this website) avoid the news like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But associations and priming are not the only features of System 1. Let’s see how it processes information based on its cognitive ease and familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fooled-by-cognitive-ease&quot;&gt;Fooled by Cognitive Ease&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen earlier, the brain is made of billions of neurons connected to each other. When a connection between two neurons is activated, it becomes stronger: the strength of the signal increases and more synapses (the connections between dendrites and axons) are likely to be created between the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wiring has a consequence on how the brain processes concepts. The more the brain encounters a concept, the stronger the underlying neuronal connections become, and the easier the concept will be to retrieve next time we access it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;ease&lt;/em&gt; is fundamental here: the easier it is to retrieve a concept, the less the effort done by the brain to by the brain and the less strain on System 1. But what happens next is intrinsic to System 1: the less strain it experiences, the more “familiar” it is with the idea, &lt;strong&gt;and it considers it more and more credible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can happen in many different forms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;having a repeated experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;having been primed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;being in a good mood&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cognitive_ease.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;angry&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Source: Thinking, fast and slow, Daniel Kahneman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intrinsic wiring of System 1 has thus a very peculiar behavior: &lt;strong&gt;it equals ease of cognition with familiarity and truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would that be? Once again, because it is the most efficient tradeoff between being one hundred percent right and expanding countless amounts of glucose energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, ideas and concepts that repeat themselves are true: apples fall down from the tree and not toward the tree branch, 2+2 is always equal to 4 (and the more it is repeated, the more we are getting comfortable with its truth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, politicians and unscrupulous marketers have understood this since a long time. In reality, repeating a lie for a time long enough does not make the lie become the truth. &lt;em&gt;But in your brain, it does!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, System 1 only calls System 2 for help when it is either confused, detect an anomaly or it cannot process the cognitive load of a given task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a given sentence is repeated again and again, System 1 will thus trust it more and more, and never call System 2 to the rescue. This is where many of our biases come from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirmation bias: we only seek the facts that confirm a belief. As these facts are likely to be already stored in our brain, they are easier to retrieve. Furthermore, contrarian facts will impose cognitive strain on the brain, and System 2 will surely have to work hard. But we know that System 2 works hard only parsimoniously!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recency and Saliency bias: events that just happened are easier to recall than older facts. It works the same with vivid memories. As a result, these facts are usually more familiar and thus “truer” than other facts. For instance, more people are worried about plane crashes compared to car crashes because the former is more spectacular, and when it happens, news channels make sure to report it again and again and again. Car crashes are much more mundane and thus less reported, less salient. But when we look at the crashes statistics &lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;, the results are clear: you should be way more worried about dying in a car crash (odds of 1 to 114) than in a plane crash (odds of 1 to 9’821). Dying in a plane crash is 85 times less likely!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Availability bias, also called “What you see is all there is”: When you see a text, a thesis, or a given context, the elements laying in front of your eyes are much easier to take into account that what is not there. As a result, &lt;em&gt;we tend to weight what is present more than what is absent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once again, we should not be mad about it, because most of the time our brain works just fine. On the other hand, we should be aware of such shortcomings so we can try to avoid stepping into cognitive situations where we would be easily tricked…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for the 2 agents model of our brain made famous by the works of Kahneman and Tversky! We have constantly two kinds of circuitry running in our brain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One that is very fast, effortless, working mainly by associations and judging by cognitive ease: System 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another that is slow, deliberate, lazy and which consumes a lot of energy: our System 2, to which we often refer when talking about “reason”, “will”, or “self-control”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System 1 runs continuously and generates a flow of ideas that System 2 can then approve or reject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System 1 and System 2 use shortcuts so that we can have a very good tradeoff between accuracy and energy consumption. This has been a superb advantage from an evolution point of view against other species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doing so comes at a cost, and sometimes System 1 and System 2 can be tricked, both in their own ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 can judge familiar concepts more likely to be true&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 will be more open to generate ideas linked to a given idea if it has been “primed” with a similar idea beforehand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is only so much that System 2 can monitor: cognitive problems are very consuming, both in energy, attention and willpower. As a result, a busy System 2 can become totally blind to its surrounding. A strained System 2 will also perform poorly on its next cognitive task, hence a big need to rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The result is 408, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

For this reason, it is important to have a good idea of how the brain works so we can take good decisions and live a good life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of what follows has been inspired by the excellent book &lt;em&gt;Behave: The biology of humans at our best and worst&lt;/em&gt;, by Robert Sapolsky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am aware that what follows may be a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; simplification of how the brain actually works. But I still think it is a very useful model…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the brain made of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;neurons-and-transmitters&quot;&gt;Neurons and Transmitters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;neuron-basics&quot;&gt;Neuron basics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain and the nervous system are principally made of two kind of cells: neurons and glial cells. Neurons are responsible for transmitting information. When you take a decision, neurons are at work. Glial cells supports neurons and provide them with insulation between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s focus on neurons. Your brain contains around 90 billion neurons. Here is what a neuron looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/neuron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Neuron&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Source: Behave, Robert Sapolsky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one end of the neuron we find small filaments called dendrites. The dendrites receive information from other neurons. At the other hand is located the axon, which ends in numerous terminals. These terminals will transmit the information to the next neuron, by connecting to his dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message transmitted by a neuron is an electrical flow. The inside of the membrane of a neuron contains ions (both positive and negative), just like the environment of the neuron. The distribution of these ions will determine the state of the neuron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a simplified summary, a neuron has two states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The resting potential&lt;/em&gt;: this is when the neuron is not excited and has “nothing to say”. Its electrical charge is then negative compared to its environment: -70mV&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the neuron receives a signal through its dendrites, its membrane will open, the ions will change their distribution, and overall the net effect will be that the neuron is more positively charged : +30mV. It is then in a state called &lt;em&gt;Action Potential&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neuron will thus continuously commute between two states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Action potential: “I have something to say”…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resting potential: “I have nothing to say”…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the neuron switch to an action potential, this potential propagates along the axon and is transmitted  through the axon terminals to the next neurons’ dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;synapses-activation-and-connections&quot;&gt;Synapses, activation and connections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it gets a bit more difficult: a neuron is not that easily excited! If it receives an excitation signal from another neuron, this signal won’t be enough to switch from a resting potential to an action potential. Instead, its potential will become just a little bit less negative (it will go for instance from -70mV to -60 mV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to switch to an action potential, the neuron needs to receive excitation signals from many neurons at the same time! It has in effect an activation function : there is a threshold to overcome so that it actually switches. For a signal to be transmitted between neurons, a lot of connections have to be made. And as you can imagine, there are indeed a monstrous number of such connections in the brain: around 100 trillion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about these connections: between the axon terminals of an emitting neuron and the dendrites of a receiving neuron, there is a space called the &lt;em&gt;synapse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the synapse, the axon will send chemical compounds called &lt;em&gt;neurotransmitters&lt;/em&gt;, which are received by the dendrites of the receiving neuron. The more neurotransmitters received, the stronger the transmitted signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these transmitters are actually famous, we will talk about them later: dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Synapse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Synapse&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Source: Behave, Robert Sapolsky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: you may have heard of Indians from South American hunting with blowpipes and darts poisoned with curare. This poison acts by inhibiting the acetylcholine neurotransmitter. This transmitter is responsible (among other things) for stimulating your diaphragm to contract. Poisoned with curare, the target stop breathing and dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have many different neurotransmitters, they have different effects on neurons. In particular, there are transmitters that, instead of increasing the potential of the neuron (to get closer of the action potential) actually do the opposite. They decrease the potential of the receiving neuron, and make it harder for him to get activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important consequence of this is that some neurons can inhibit other neurons and we can generalize it to the whole brain! Indeed, some brain parts can inhibit other parts of the brain. When a group of neurons send a signal to activate or inhibit another group of neurons, the mechanism is called a &lt;em&gt;neuronal projection&lt;/em&gt;. We will see next that neuronal projections are the meat and potatoes of how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, now that we have a basic understanding of how neurons work, let’s have a look at the bigger picture: the brain and its different parts, and how they interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-three-layered-brain&quot;&gt;The three-layered brain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a fully accurate model of the brain would prove absolutely impossible. Nevertheless, Paul McLean proposed a fascinating model describing the brain in three layers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first and deeper layer, called the reptilian brain (or the brain stem). It is in charge of the heart’s regulation, breathing, perspiration and temperature, as well as various primary needs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second layer is called the limbic system, and communicates directly with the first layer. The limbic brain is responsible for emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The outer and third layer, called the neocortex. It is responsible for cognition, memory, abstraction, language. To get any action done, it needs to communicate with the limbic system, who will in turn communicate with the reptilian brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/three-layered-brain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three-layered brain&quot; /&gt;  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-reptilian-brain&quot;&gt;The Reptilian Brain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reptilian brain is in charge of autonomic functions of the body, which are divided in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sympathetic nervous system (SNS), who manages the response of the human body to stressing stimuli (increase of the heart rate, pulmonary rate…) The SNS is absolutely primordial in cases of emergency (If you see a lion, your SNS takes over, increasing your heart rate and optimizing many  variables in your body to perform the sprint of your life). The SNS neurotransmitters are the noradrenaline and the adrenaline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The parasympathetic nervous system, which on the other hand maintains the body in a state of rest and digestion. Its neurotransmitter is the acetylcholine (whom we met before in the curare example…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To function properly, the human body needs a good balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and the reptilian brain is responsible for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What is very important to understand is that any physical action taken by your body has been triggered through your reptilian brain. Either directly, or indirectly from upper layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a full bladder, the circuitry of your reptilian brain will vote for urinating, which is an autonomic bodily function. Now if you experience something absolutely terrifying, your limbic system (in charge of emotions) will persuade your reptilian brain to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, emotions can change bodily functions through neuronal projections, and we will see as well how cognition can impact emotions or vice versa. The neocortex and the limbic system have something to say about how your bodily function perform!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lymbic-system&quot;&gt;The Lymbic System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we said, the limbic system is the second layer of the brain, responsible for emotions. In particular, let’s focus on an area the size of a small nut, called the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core role of the amygdala is to throw alerts when something is off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly comes from the time where our ancestors were living in the Savanah: if something moves in a bush, it is much better to throw an alert through the amygdala (this is a lion!) , run away and think later. In case it was actually a lion, the amygdala saved our life. The guy staying there thinking “Maybe it is a lion, maybe not, i am not sure, let’s check it out” would not have survived and passed its genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this life-saving feature comes with a lot of drawbacks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is preponderant in aggression : when it is stimulated, the aggressivity of an individual increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is also a central element in experiencing fear, anxiety and incertitude, even in a social context.  For instance, when someone is not sure about how to comply to the social norms of his surroundings, he will experience an activation of his amygdala, which then will do a neuronal projection to the reptilian brain so that the person will show physical signs of anxiety…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A troubling fact about the amygdala is how it processes sensory data (image, sounds, …). The amygdala has access to super fast sensory neural circuitry, but which lacks accuracy. When our eyes see something, the amygdala is usually among the firsts notified (way before the rest of our cognitive circuits).  On the other hand, the amygdala is never really sure of what it saw, since its neural connections lack precision. The picture it receives is blurry and lacking contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high stress environment, this can lead to tragic situations: for instance, the amygdala could decide it is seeing a gun, whereas the cognitive zones of the brain would figure out it is actually a cellphone. Since the amygdala will be the first one to act on the reptilian brain, it is easy to imagine what the consequences could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the amygdala has also an impact on the outer layer of the brain (the neocortex, see below). For instance, by influencing the part responsible for factual memory (the hippocampus) the brain can learn a fear!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But enough about the amygdala, let’s talk now about the last layer of the brain, in charge of cognitive activities… the neocortex!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-neocortex&quot;&gt;The Neocortex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outer layer of the brain is called the neocortex. It is the part of the brain we often link to &lt;em&gt;“Rationality”&lt;/em&gt;. In a nutshell, its role is to choose the harder choice when it is the right thing to do. It regulates emotions, masters the impulsivity, organizes the knowledge strategically and then initiates an action based on a decision…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neocortex is the most recently evolve part of the brain. When we compare a human brain with a primate’s one, the most striking difference will be in the size of the neocortex, and most notably in the pre-frontal cortex (the part located in the front of the brain). The pre-frontal cortex has a role of decider and often chooses between several conflicting choices (for instance, an cognitive decision versus an emotive one). It also has a dominating role in sorting things by categories and creating abstractions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is most active when we focus on a task, or we pay attention to a detail. It will be intensively stimulated as well when we delay gratification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the frontal cortex consumes a lot of energy, especially when it is focusing on something. If we allocate many resources to a cognitive task, the following tasks will be negatively impacted, because the brain does not have access to infinite amounts of energy. &lt;strong&gt;As a direct consequence, willpower is a finite resource!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another limitation: compared to the rest of the brain, the neocortex is quite slow to process information… it is the perfect antagonist of the amygdala: when the neocortex is slow but with highly accurate, the amygdala and the limbic system are super fast, but grossly inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the neocortex is usually able to take the “right” decision by inhibiting the limbic system (remember the neuronal projection inhibiting other neurons!). This forbids the brain to take purely emotional emotions, however we will now see that it is not always the case…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sequence-of-decision&quot;&gt;Sequence of decision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when the brain is stimulated by an external system, for instance seeing a new picture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the quickest to react will be the limbic system, thanks to its very fast circuitry. At this moment, the brain will a rough idea of what is going on and start experiencing emotions, &lt;em&gt;but it is not yet conscious of it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the information will arrive to the neocortex that will process it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, something weird happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would expect our brain to be fully rational and to handle in a correct an cognitively accurate the information provided by the signal, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it is not that simple… The result will unfortunately be very dependent on the focus that we allocate to the processing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If we are focused and mentally rested, the neocortex will activate, organize knowledge and take a rational decision based on facts, as we would expect.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But that’s actually not often the case. What happens most of the case is that, being very demanding in energy, the cortex will become lazy, and become influenced by the limbic system. Instead of reasoning rationally, the neocortex will look for a reason to &lt;em&gt;rationalize&lt;/em&gt; the decision that has already been taken by the limbic system…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is huge; most of the time, the human brain is not a rational machine, but a &lt;em&gt;rationalizing&lt;/em&gt; machine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first case, it starts from the facts to arrive to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second case, the brain starts from the conclusion it wants to reach (and dictated by the limbic system), and selects the facts that support this conclusion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the brain has a built-in confirmation bias mechanism… if we don’t pay attention, we are most likely to only filter arguments that comfort our pre-existing opinions…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Faced with the &lt;strong&gt;choice between changing&lt;/strong&gt; one’s mind and &lt;strong&gt;proving&lt;/strong&gt; that there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the &lt;strong&gt;proof&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;John Kenneth Galbraith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As such, this is the perfect topic to kickstart this website! What is Financial Independence? How do we define it? How to reach it? How long does it take?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow me down the rabbit hole.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go with a broad definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Financial Independence is about accumulating enough wealth to live without having to work for money anymore. Your assets generate enough cash to cover your expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. If you have assets generating an income superior to your expenses, you are financially independent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it can come with all sorts of flavors… Some will want to be wealthy enough to afford to pay all their luxuries. Others will be happy with cash flows covering only their basic needs (housing, health, food and transportation). Most flavors are between these two broad categories. (Side Note: Financial Independence is often abbreviated FI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the concept has been there for a long time, it really took off around 2010 when blogs such as  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/&quot;&gt;Mr Money Mustache&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://earlyretirementextreme.com/&quot;&gt;Early Retirement Extreme&lt;/a&gt; started documenting how to reach financial independence. What made people really interested in the topic was that often these bloggers had reached FI &lt;em&gt;in a dozen of years or less&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Switzerland (my home country), the two most famous blogs on the subject are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mustachianpost.com/&quot;&gt;Mustachian Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://retireinprogress.com/&quot;&gt;Retire in Progress&lt;/a&gt;. Go visit them if you are interested on the subject!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-reach-financial-independence&quot;&gt;How do you reach Financial Independence?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will assume that you are not a playing in the NBA, you did not win the lottery, you did not inherit from a wealthy distant uncle or what-not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching FI is actually simple and can be summarized in three step:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend less than you earn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Invest the difference in productive assets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat until these assets are producing enough income to cover your expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, very simple, right? Simple, &lt;em&gt;but not easy&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s dig deaper into these steps…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-spend-less-than-you-earn&quot;&gt;1) Spend less than you earn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most important step of all. If you want to have some money to invest, it needs to come from somewhere. And this somewhere is really nothing special, it is just the money that is left after you paid all your expenses… in other words, your savings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why it is critical to spend way less than you earn and to maximize your savings. You will never be able to own enough assets if you do not save enough money. While general personal finance websites would recommand that you save at least 10% of your earnings, we will see later that it is way too low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to reach Financial Independence in a reasonable time, I’d advise to start saving at least &lt;strong&gt;40% of your income, or even 50-60%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Saving half of my income? But that is strictly impossible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is certainly not easy, most people in the FI community manage to save this kind of money by using two strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful about your expenses&lt;/strong&gt;, especially recurring expenses such as the Big 4: Housing, Health, Food and Transportation. These four items take usually the biggest part of your budget, so it is time to be smart about them, minimizing them, while not feeling like an hermit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase your income&lt;/strong&gt;. While reducing expenses is certainly needed, there is one point after which we run into diminishing returns. That’s when it is time to increase your income: change job, do a side hustle, create a small business, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being more specific about saving money would fill many other posts. But the main lesson is this: &lt;em&gt;Save as much as you can, so you can start investing your hard-earned savings into productive assets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-invest-the-difference-in-productive-assets&quot;&gt;2) Invest the difference in productive assets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have started saving a significant amount of money, it is time to start investing it in productive assets. There are two important words in this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investing&quot;&gt;Investing:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to clarify first what I mean by investing. The word has many meanings in our culture, so it’s time to be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing is about renouncing now to a certain amount of purchasing power, in the hope to receive back more purchasing power in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s see two or three examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buying a car, while often expensive, is not an investment. Its value depreciate quickly over time and is never gained back. It could be an investment if you use the car to perform activities that brings in significant money (ex: you buy a truck and transform it in food truck.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By the same token, just because something is expensive does not mean it is an investment. You need to have reasonable hope of at least getting back your purchasing power to name it that way. Think about it the next time a friend tells you he &lt;em&gt;invested&lt;/em&gt; in this brand new TV-set.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the other hand, buying a diversified portfolio of shares with a long term horizon, has historically proven to generate a compounded return of 7% to 8 % per annum. After 10 years, such a portfolio will double in value. That’s what i call an improved purchasing power!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;productive-assets&quot;&gt;Productive Assets:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we are clear with the meaning of &lt;em&gt;investing&lt;/em&gt;, you need to figure out in what to invest your savings. There are many different assets available, and this can be very confusing. But as a rule of thumb, invest in productive assets, i.e. assets whose underlyings are producing cash flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As we have seen, stocks are productive assets. They represent a shared ownership in a business, and this business is supposed to make profits by selling goods or services to customers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rental Real Estate is a productive asset: it generates cash flows to the owner by renting the housing unit to a tenant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gold is not really a productive asset. It has a nice property: it keeps its value. Over the long term, an ounce of gold in 1800 provided as much purchasing power as an ounce of gold now. There are of course fluctuations in between, but you get the picture. The downside of gold is that over the long term it won’t really increase your purchasing power&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cryptocurrencies are not (yet) productive assets. We haven’t found yet a stable way to use crypto-currencies that would entice customers to pay for. Sure, the value of Bitcoin and Co. has fluctuated a lot in the last few years. But at this stage it is still more speculation than a true productive asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-repeat-until-your-assets-are-producing-enough-cash-to-cover-your-expenses&quot;&gt;3) Repeat until your assets are producing enough cash to cover your expenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much is enough to cover your needs? There is a lot of debates on the exact amount, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study&quot;&gt;Trinity Study&lt;/a&gt;  is a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published in 1998, the study defines a “safe withdrawal rate”, equal to 4% of your assets. Imagine someone withdrawing only 4% of his funds every year, while keeping the rest invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to the study, such a person would have a 97% chance of never running out of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gave birth to the &lt;em&gt;4% rule&lt;/em&gt; :  to be financially free your annual expenses should be less than 4% of your capital. Another way to state it is that your capital should be worth at least 25 times your annual expenses (because 25 = 1/4%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is currently a lot of controversy about the validity of the Trinity Study, and people usually recommend to be a bit more conservative a save up to 33 times your annual expenses. For more details, you can consult the outstanding work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/12/07/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-1-intro/&quot;&gt;Early Retirement Now&lt;/a&gt; on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But yeah, if you don’t want to overcomplicate things, target a capital equal to around 25 and 30 times your annual spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what is your target, this opens the room for many questions! How long does it take? How much should you save? What is the impact of the yield of your assets?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hem. It’s time for some maths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(if you are maths-phobic, you can directly jump to the remarks.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-maths-behind-all-of-that&quot;&gt;The maths behind all of that&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let’s call C0 your initial capital (i.e your current savings).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each year, you will save an amount S.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your annual expenses are E. You will thus want to reach an capital target T equal to 25 * E&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your investments have a yearly rate of return of r%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s call C(n) your capital at year n. Obviously, C(0) is equal to C0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After one year, C0 is invested in productive assets returning r%, and you have saved as well an additional S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;C(1) = (1+r)  C_0 + S&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way, after an additional year, C(1) had returns of r%, and you saved yet another S&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;C(2) = (1+r)  C(1) + S = (1+r)  [ (1+r)  C_0 + S ] + S&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;C(n+1) = (1+r)  C(n) + S&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can show by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction&quot;&gt;mathematical induction&lt;/a&gt; that C(n) can be rewritten:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;C(n) = (1+r) ^n  (C_0 + \frac {S}{r})  - \frac {S}{r}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At year N, C(N) reaches the target capital T ( equal to 25 times E)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;C(N) = T = (1+r) ^N  (C0 + \frac {S}{r})  - \frac {S}{r}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving for N, we get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;N =  \frac  {\ln(  \frac  {T +\frac {S}{r}}  {(C_0 + \frac {S}{r}}) }{ \ln (1+r) }&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. If you start without any capital, you can simplify with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;N =  \frac  {\ln( 1 + \frac  {r T }{S} )}  { \ln (1+r) }&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that    $ \frac{T}{S} =  \frac {25 E}{S}$   , we can introduce the concept of saving rate, which is equal to the ratio between your savings and your revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\sigma = \frac {Savings}{Revenues} = \frac {Savings}{Savings + Expenses } = \frac {S}{S + E }&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We show that   $ \frac{E}{S} =  (\frac {1}{\sigma} - 1) $&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and thus, our final result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;N =  \frac  {\ln( 1 + 25 r (\frac  {1 }{\sigma}-1))}  { \ln (1+r) }&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remarks&quot;&gt;Remarks:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It does not look like a lot but it is actually huge. Knowing only your investment yield and your saving rate (i.e how much of your revenue are you saving), you can figure out how long it takes to be financially independent. Nothing else matters except these two variables!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see how long it takes to reach FI with different values of investment yields and saving rates:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/NSavingRate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Results&quot; /&gt;
Someone saving half of his income and investing it at a 10% annual rate will be financially independent in 13 years. With the same annual returns, someone saving only 10% of his income will only reach financial freedom in 33 years! This is not a reasonable timeframe. Even less so if annual returns are less than 10%… The time needed to reach FI jumps then very quickly to over 50 years…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As you can see, the two conditions needed to reach financial freedom within 15 years are an annual investment returns of more than 5% and a saving rate of more than 50%!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s enough theory for today, dear reader!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend way less that you earn, invest the difference in productive assets, rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s only the starting point.
