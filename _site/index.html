    "body": "Hello dear reader! Welcome to From Fool to Wise, a blog about my quest towards acquiring wisdom, making better decisions and living a good life. I’m Julien, a french software engineer living in Zürich, Switzerland since 2016. On this blog I plan to talk about many topics:  Rationality Avoiding Stupidity Financial Independence Making good decisions Mental Models Happiness and familyWhere it all started: Soon after I arrived in Switzerland, I became quickly interested in the topic of financial independence. In short, this is about having enough passive income to cover your basic needs and not needing to work for money. I dug deep in the subject, but quickly I realized that the more I went through it, the more new questions were arising:  If I don’t work, what will I do with my life? Why do I want freedom? Am I sure that financial independence will be translated in freedom to, rather than freedom from? Financial independence is about making sound financial decisions. It is avoidance of stupidity applied to the financial world. How can I translate it to other areas of my life? Why is it that seemingly smart people are often unhappy? Why is it that those same smart people make often dumb decisions?I quickly realized that what I initially thought was only about maths and money would very quickly drift towards more philosophical questions! I needed someone who could help me to think about these themes. But fortunately, I was far to be the first person asking these questions. From ancient stoic philosopher to contemporary role models like Charlie Munger and Naval Ravikant, I discovered new frameworks to help me think in my everyday life about these difficult questions. This website is a documentation of my discovery of these frameworks, and how I apply them in my life to stay away from stupid mistakes and try to lean towards a wiser life. What should you expect from this blog?: Good question, dear reader. My purpose in writing this blog is to expose my thought process, so I can discuss it with you afterward. My blog will thus allow me to:  Learn about many topics, mainly about how to live a good live and make better decisions Meet people with a similar mindset. Where are you guys? Discover people who are much farther down the road through their personal journey towards worldly wisdom.  Highlight my stupid mistakes when they occur, so that other people can learn from them.  Sharpen my mind. Explaining a topic to someone else is learning it a second time. That’s all for today! Let’s hope there will be many more posts to come! "

    "body": "2019/12/18 - Your brain is the place where all your decisions take place. For this reason, it is important to have a good idea of how the brain works so we can take good decisions and live a good life! A lot of what follows has been inspired by the excellent book Behave: The biology of humans at our best and worst, by Robert Sapolsky. Disclaimer: I am aware that what follows may be a huge simplification of how the brain actually works. But I still think it is a very useful model… So what is the brain made of? Neurons and Transmitters: Neuron basics: The brain and the nervous system are principally made of two kind of cells: neurons and glial cells. Neurons are responsible for transmitting information. When you take a decision, neurons are at work. Glial cells supports neurons and provide them with insulation between them. Let’s focus on neurons. Your brain contains around 90 billion neurons. Here is what a neuron looks like:   Source: Behave, Robert SapolskyAt one end of the neuron we find small filaments called dendrites. The dendrites receive information from other neurons. At the other hand is located the axon, which ends in numerous terminals. These terminals will transmit the information to the next neuron, by connecting to his dendrites. The message transmitted by a neuron is an electrical flow. The inside of the membrane of a neuron contains ions (both positive and negative), just like the environment of the neuron. The distribution of these ions will determine the state of the neuron. In a simplified summary, a neuron has two states:  The resting potential: this is when the neuron is not excited and has “nothing to say”. Its electrical charge is then negative compared to its environment: -70mV When the neuron receives a signal through its dendrites, its membrane will open, the ions will change their distribution, and overall the net effect will be that the neuron is more positively charged : +30mV. It is then in a state called Action PotentialThe neuron will thus continuously commute between two states:  Action potential: “I have something to say”… Resting potential: “I have nothing to say”…When the neuron switch to an action potential, this potential propagates along the axon and is transmitted through the axon terminals to the next neurons’ dendrites. Synapses, activation and connections: Now it gets a bit more difficult: a neuron is not that easily excited! If it receives an excitation signal from another neuron, this signal won’t be enough to switch from a resting potential to an action potential. Instead, its potential will become just a little bit less negative (it will go for instance from -70mV to -60 mV). In order to switch to an action potential, the neuron needs to receive excitation signals from many neurons at the same time! It has in effect an activation function : there is a threshold to overcome so that it actually switches. For a signal to be transmitted between neurons, a lot of connections have to be made. And as you can imagine, there are indeed a monstrous number of such connections in the brain: around 100 trillion! Let’s talk about these connections: between the axon terminals of an emitting neuron and the dendrites of a receiving neuron, there is a space called the synapse. Through the synapse, the axon will send chemical compounds called neurotransmitters, which are received by the dendrites of the receiving neuron. The more neurotransmitters received, the stronger the transmitted signal. Some of these transmitters are actually famous, we will talk about them later: dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline…   Source: Behave, Robert SapolskyFun fact: you may have heard of Indians from South American hunting with blowpipes and darts poisoned with curare. This poison acts by inhibiting the acetylcholine neurotransmitter. This transmitter is responsible (among other things) for stimulating your diaphragm to contract. Poisoned with curare, the target stop breathing and dies. As we have many different neurotransmitters, they have different effects on neurons. In particular, there are transmitters that, instead of increasing the potential of the neuron (to get closer of the action potential) actually do the opposite. They decrease the potential of the receiving neuron, and make it harder for him to get activated. The important consequence of this is that some neurons can inhibit other neurons and we can generalize it to the whole brain! Indeed, some brain parts can inhibit other parts of the brain. When a group of neurons send a signal to activate or inhibit another group of neurons, the mechanism is called a neuronal projection. We will see next that neuronal projections are the meat and potatoes of how the brain works. Alright, now that we have a basic understanding of how neurons work, let’s have a look at the bigger picture: the brain and its different parts, and how they interact. The three-layered brain: Having a fully accurate model of the brain would prove absolutely impossible. Nevertheless, Paul McLean proposed a fascinating model describing the brain in three layers:  The first and deeper layer, called the reptilian brain (or the brain stem). It is in charge of the heart’s regulation, breathing, perspiration and temperature, as well as various primary needs.  The second layer is called the limbic system, and communicates directly with the first layer. The limbic brain is responsible for emotions.  The outer and third layer, called the neocortex. It is responsible for cognition, memory, abstraction, language. To get any action done, it needs to communicate with the limbic system, who will in turn communicate with the reptilian brain.   The Reptilian Brain: The reptilian brain is in charge of autonomic functions of the body, which are divided in two parts:  The sympathetic nervous system (SNS), who manages the response of the human body to stressing stimuli (increase of the heart rate, pulmonary rate…) The SNS is absolutely primordial in cases of emergency (If you see a lion, your SNS takes over, increasing your heart rate and optimizing many variables in your body to perform the sprint of your life). The SNS neurotransmitters are the noradrenaline and the adrenaline.  The parasympathetic nervous system, which on the other hand maintains the body in a state of rest and digestion. Its neurotransmitter is the acetylcholine (whom we met before in the curare example…)To function properly, the human body needs a good balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and the reptilian brain is responsible for it.  What is very important to understand is that any physical action taken by your body has been triggered through your reptilian brain. Either directly, or indirectly from upper layers. Let’s see an example: If you have a full bladder, the circuitry of your reptilian brain will vote for urinating, which is an autonomic bodily function. Now if you experience something absolutely terrifying, your limbic system (in charge of emotions) will persuade your reptilian brain to do the same. As a consequence, emotions can change bodily functions through neuronal projections, and we will see as well how cognition can impact emotions or vice versa. The neocortex and the limbic system have something to say about how your bodily function perform! The Lymbic System: As we said, the limbic system is the second layer of the brain, responsible for emotions. In particular, let’s focus on an area the size of a small nut, called the amygdala. The core role of the amygdala is to throw alerts when something is off. It certainly comes from the time where our ancestors were living in the Savanah: if something moves in a bush, it is much better to throw an alert through the amygdala (this is a lion!) , run away and think later. In case it was actually a lion, the amygdala saved our life. The guy staying there thinking “Maybe it is a lion, maybe not, i am not sure, let’s check it out” would not have survived and passed its genes. But this life-saving feature comes with a lot of drawbacks… The amygdala is preponderant in aggression : when it is stimulated, the aggressivity of an individual increases. The amygdala is also a central element in experiencing fear, anxiety and incertitude, even in a social context.  For instance, when someone is not sure about how to comply to the social norms of his surroundings, he will experience an activation of his amygdala, which then will do a neuronal projection to the reptilian brain so that the person will show physical signs of anxiety… A troubling fact about the amygdala is how it processes sensory data (image, sounds, …). The amygdala has access to super fast sensory neural circuitry, but which lacks accuracy. When our eyes see something, the amygdala is usually among the firsts notified (way before the rest of our cognitive circuits).  On the other hand, the amygdala is never really sure of what it saw, since its neural connections lack precision. The picture it receives is blurry and lacking contrast. In high stress environment, this can lead to tragic situations: for instance, the amygdala could decide it is seeing a gun, whereas the cognitive zones of the brain would figure out it is actually a cellphone. Since the amygdala will be the first one to act on the reptilian brain, it is easy to imagine what the consequences could be. But the amygdala has also an impact on the outer layer of the brain (the neocortex, see below). For instance, by influencing the part responsible for factual memory (the hippocampus) the brain can learn a fear! But enough about the amygdala, let’s talk now about the last layer of the brain, in charge of cognitive activities… the neocortex! The Neocortex: The outer layer of the brain is called the neocortex. It is the part of the brain we often link to “Rationality”. In a nutshell, its role is to choose the harder choice when it is the right thing to do. It regulates emotions, masters the impulsivity, organizes the knowledge strategically and then initiates an action based on a decision… The neocortex is the most recently evolve part of the brain. When we compare a human brain with a primate’s one, the most striking difference will be in the size of the neocortex, and most notably in the pre-frontal cortex (the part located in the front of the brain). The pre-frontal cortex has a role of decider and often chooses between several conflicting choices (for instance, an cognitive decision versus an emotive one). It also has a dominating role in sorting things by categories and creating abstractions! It is most active when we focus on a task, or we pay attention to a detail. It will be intensively stimulated as well when we delay gratification. Unfortunately, the frontal cortex consumes a lot of energy, especially when it is focusing on something. If we allocate many resources to a cognitive task, the following tasks will be negatively impacted, because the brain does not have access to infinite amounts of energy. As a direct consequence, willpower is a finite resource! Another limitation: compared to the rest of the brain, the neocortex is quite slow to process information… it is the perfect antagonist of the amygdala: when the neocortex is slow but with highly accurate, the amygdala and the limbic system are super fast, but grossly inaccurate. Finally, the neocortex is usually able to take the “right” decision by inhibiting the limbic system (remember the neuronal projection inhibiting other neurons!). This forbids the brain to take purely emotional emotions, however we will now see that it is not always the case… Sequence of decision: What happens when the brain is stimulated by an external system, for instance seeing a new picture? We know that the quickest to react will be the limbic system, thanks to its very fast circuitry. At this moment, the brain will a rough idea of what is going on and start experiencing emotions, but it is not yet conscious of it. Then the information will arrive to the neocortex that will process it. But then, something weird happens. We would expect our brain to be fully rational and to handle in a correct an cognitively accurate the information provided by the signal, right? Well, it is not that simple… The result will unfortunately be very dependent on the focus that we allocate to the processing…  If we are focused and mentally rested, the neocortex will activate, organize knowledge and take a rational decision based on facts, as we would expect.  But that’s actually not often the case. What happens most of the case is that, being very demanding in energy, the cortex will become lazy, and become influenced by the limbic system. Instead of reasoning rationally, the neocortex will look for a reason to rationalize the decision that has already been taken by the limbic system…This is huge; most of the time, the human brain is not a rational machine, but a rationalizing machine! In the first case, it starts from the facts to arrive to a conclusion. In the second case, the brain starts from the conclusion it wants to reach (and dictated by the limbic system), and selects the facts that support this conclusion! As a result, the brain has a built-in confirmation bias mechanism… if we don’t pay attention, we are most likely to only filter arguments that comfort our pre-existing opinions…  Faced with the choice between changing one’s mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.

    "title": "What is Financial Independence?",
    "body": "2019/12/04 - As every journey starts somewhere, mine began when I discovered the concept of Financial Independence (See About). As such, this is the perfect topic to kickstart this website! What is Financial Independence? How do we define it? How to reach it? How long does it take? Follow me down the rabbit hole. Let’s go with a broad definition:  Financial Independence is about accumulating enough wealth to live without having to work for money anymore. Your assets generate enough cash to cover your expenses. That’s it. If you have assets generating an income superior to your expenses, you are financially independent! Now it can come with all sorts of flavors… Some will want to be wealthy enough to afford to pay all their luxuries. Others will be happy with cash flows covering only their basic needs (housing, health, food and transportation). Most flavors are between these two broad categories. (Side Note: Financial Independence is often abbreviated FI). Although the concept has been there for a long time, it really took off around 2010 when blogs such as Mr Money Mustache or Early Retirement Extreme started documenting how to reach financial independence. What made people really interested in the topic was that often these bloggers had reached FI in a dozen of years or less. In Switzerland (my home country), the two most famous blogs on the subject are the Mustachian Post and Retire in Progress. Go visit them if you are interested on the subject! How do you reach Financial Independence?: I will assume that you are not a playing in the NBA, you did not win the lottery, you did not inherit from a wealthy distant uncle or what-not. Reaching FI is actually simple and can be summarized in three step:  Spend less than you earn Invest the difference in productive assets Repeat until these assets are producing enough income to cover your expenses. As I said, very simple, right? Simple, but not easy. Let’s dig deaper into these steps… 1) Spend less than you earn: This is the most important step of all. If you want to have some money to invest, it needs to come from somewhere. And this somewhere is really nothing special, it is just the money that is left after you paid all your expenses… in other words, your savings! That’s why it is critical to spend way less than you earn and to maximize your savings. You will never be able to own enough assets if you do not save enough money. While general personal finance websites would recommand that you save at least 10% of your earnings, we will see later that it is way too low. To be able to reach Financial Independence in a reasonable time, I’d advise to start saving at least 40% of your income, or even 50-60%.  Saving half of my income? But that is strictly impossible! While this is certainly not easy, most people in the FI community manage to save this kind of money by using two strategies:  Be mindful about your expenses, especially recurring expenses such as the Big 4: Housing, Health, Food and Transportation. These four items take usually the biggest part of your budget, so it is time to be smart about them, minimizing them, while not feeling like an hermit.  Increase your income. While reducing expenses is certainly needed, there is one point after which we run into diminishing returns. That’s when it is time to increase your income: change job, do a side hustle, create a small business, etc. Being more specific about saving money would fill many other posts. But the main lesson is this: Save as much as you can, so you can start investing your hard-earned savings into productive assets. 2) Invest the difference in productive assets: Once you have started saving a significant amount of money, it is time to start investing it in productive assets. There are two important words in this sentence: Investing:: I wanted to clarify first what I mean by investing. The word has many meanings in our culture, so it’s time to be accurate.  Investing is about renouncing now to a certain amount of purchasing power, in the hope to receive back more purchasing power in the future. With that in mind, let’s see two or three examples:  Buying a car, while often expensive, is not an investment. Its value depreciate quickly over time and is never gained back. It could be an investment if you use the car to perform activities that brings in significant money (ex: you buy a truck and transform it in food truck. ) By the same token, just because something is expensive does not mean it is an investment. You need to have reasonable hope of at least getting back your purchasing power to name it that way. Think about it the next time a friend tells you he invested in this brand new TV-set.  On the other hand, buying a diversified portfolio of shares with a long term horizon, has historically proven to generate a compounded return of 7% to 8 % per annum. After 10 years, such a portfolio will double in value. That’s what i call an improved purchasing power!Productive Assets:: Now that we are clear with the meaning of investing, you need to figure out in what to invest your savings. There are many different assets available, and this can be very confusing. But as a rule of thumb, invest in productive assets, i. e. assets whose underlyings are producing cash flows.  As we have seen, stocks are productive assets. They represent a shared ownership in a business, and this business is supposed to make profits by selling goods or services to customers Rental Real Estate is a productive asset: it generates cash flows to the owner by renting the housing unit to a tenant Gold is not really a productive asset. It has a nice property: it keeps its value. Over the long term, an ounce of gold in 1800 provided as much purchasing power as an ounce of gold now. There are of course fluctuations in between, but you get the picture. The downside of gold is that over the long term it won’t really increase your purchasing power Cryptocurrencies are not (yet) productive assets. We haven’t found yet a stable way to use crypto-currencies that would entice customers to pay for. Sure, the value of Bitcoin and Co. has fluctuated a lot in the last few years. But at this stage it is still more speculation than a true productive asset. 3) Repeat until your assets are producing enough cash to cover your expenses: How much is enough to cover your needs? There is a lot of debates on the exact amount, but the Trinity Study is a good starting point. Published in 1998, the study defines a “safe withdrawal rate”, equal to 4% of your assets. Imagine someone withdrawing only 4% of his funds every year, while keeping the rest invested.  According to the study, such a person would have a 97% chance of never running out of money. This gave birth to the 4% rule : to be financially free your annual expenses should be less than 4% of your capital. Another way to state it is that your capital should be worth at least 25 times your annual expenses (because 25 = 1/4%). There is currently a lot of controversy about the validity of the Trinity Study, and people usually recommend to be a bit more conservative a save up to 33 times your annual expenses. For more details, you can consult the outstanding work of Early Retirement Now on the subject. But yeah, if you don’t want to overcomplicate things, target a capital equal to around 25 and 30 times your annual spending. Now that you know what is your target, this opens the room for many questions! How long does it take? How much should you save? What is the impact of the yield of your assets? Hem. It’s time for some maths. (if you are maths-phobic, you can directly jump to the remarks. ) The maths behind all of that:  Let’s call C0 your initial capital (i. e your current savings).  Each year, you will save an amount S.  Your annual expenses are E. You will thus want to reach an capital target T equal to 25 * E Your investments have a yearly rate of return of r%. Let’s call C(n) your capital at year n. Obviously, C(0) is equal to C0. After one year, C0 is invested in productive assets returning r%, and you have saved as well an additional S. In the same way, after an additional year, C(1) had returns of r%, and you saved yet another S And so on: We can show by mathematical induction that C(n) can be rewritten: At year N, C(N) reaches the target capital T ( equal to 25 times E) Solving for N, we get: That’s it. If you start without any capital, you can simplify with Knowing that  $ \frac{T}{S} = \frac {25 E}{S}$  , we can introduce the concept of saving rate, which is equal to the ratio between your savings and your revenues. We show that  $ \frac{E}{S} = (\frac {1}{\sigma} - 1) $ and thus, our final result: Remarks::    It does not look like a lot but it is actually huge. Knowing only your investment yield and your saving rate (i. e how much of your revenue are you saving), you can figure out how long it takes to be financially independent. Nothing else matters except these two variables!     Let’s see how long it takes to reach FI with different values of investment yields and saving rates:  Someone saving half of his income and investing it at a 10% annual rate will be financially independent in 13 years. With the same annual returns, someone saving only 10% of his income will only reach financial freedom in 33 years! This is not a reasonable timeframe. Even less so if annual returns are less than 10%… The time needed to reach FI jumps then very quickly to over 50 years…  As you can see, the two conditions needed to reach financial freedom within 15 years are an annual investment returns of more than 5% and a saving rate of more than 50%! That’s enough theory for today, dear reader! Spend way less that you earn, invest the difference in productive assets, rinse and repeat. But that’s only the starting point. I discovered quickly that I would soon be asking more qualitative questions… "
